Just as you don’t need to be a mechanic to drive a car effectively, you don’t need to be a programmer to use R powerfully. This course focuses on giving you practical tools that will immediately enhance your analytical capabilities.\nWe embrace two key advantages that make this possible:\n\nModern Tools: The tidyverse ecosystem transforms R from a statistical programming language into an intuitive data analysis toolkit\nAI Assistance: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as your personal guide, helping you find and implement the right tools for each task",

Everyone learns differently, so we’ve provided options to suit different learning styles. Remember: our course will get you started, but these resources can help you continue your journey.\n\n1.11.1 THE Textbook\nR for Data Science (2e) is the definitive guide to modern data analysis in R, and it’s completely free online. Much of this course’s approach is inspired by this book, but with a key difference: while R4DS teaches concepts using general datasets (like diamond prices and penguin measurements), we’ll apply these same concepts directly to Chinese development finance data.\nThink of R4DS as your comprehensive reference manual. When you want to: - Understand a concept more deeply - Learn additional approaches - Explore beyond what we cover in class - Review fundamentals\nThis should be your first stop. The authors (Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund) have a gift for clear explanation, and the book is constantly updated to reflect modern best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBookmark R for Data Science now - you’ll be referring to it often!\n\n\n\n\n1.11.2 Video Learning\nIf you prefer to learn by watching, check out “R Programming for ABSOLUTE Beginners” (14 minutes). This gentle introduction is perfect if you’re feeling uncertain about where to start.\n\n\n1.11.3 Interactive Learning\nDataCamp’s Introduction to R provides hands-on practice in an online environment with immediate feedback. While DataCamp is generally a paid platform, this introductory course is free. This format worked particularly well for me when I was learning R.\n\n\n1.11.4 Community Resources\nThe R community is known for being friendly and supportive. Here’s where to find help:\n\n#rstats on Bluesky: The active R community shares tips, resources, and help\nR-Ladies: A worldwide organization promoting gender diversity in the R community\nR-bloggers: An aggregator of R-related blogs and tutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ll provide a comprehensive resource list in Chapter X, but these should get you started. The R community’s commitment to sharing knowledge means you’ll never lack for learning materials!",

    "text": "2.6 Setting Up Your Work Environment\nLet’s create an organized workspace for this course. We’ll do this together - follow along on your computer:\n\n2.6.1 Creating a Project Structure\n\nIn RStudio, click File → New File → New Project\nClick “New Directory”\nClick “New Project”\nName it “data_analysis_bootcamp”\nChoose where to save it (remember this location!)\nClick “Create Project”\n\nNow let’s create an organized folder structure. Copy and paste this code into your R console:\n\n# Create week folders and their subfolders\nfor (week in 1:4) {\n  week_folder &lt;- paste0(\"week_\", week)\n  dir.create(week_folder)\n  \n  # Create standard subfolders\n  dir.create(file.path(week_folder, \"R\"))        # Scripts and Quarto documents\n  dir.create(file.path(week_folder, \"data-raw\")) # Original data files\n  dir.create(file.path(week_folder, \"data\"))     # Processed data\n  dir.create(file.path(week_folder, \"outputs\"))  # Generated reports and figures\n}\n\nThis will create:\ndata_analysis_bootcamp/\n├── week_1/\n│   ├── R/         # R scripts and Quarto documents\n│   ├── data-raw/  # Original data files\n│   ├── data/      # Processed data\n│   └── outputs/   # Generated reports and figures\n├── week_2/\n│   ├── R/\n│   ├── data-raw/\n│   ├── data/\n│   └── outputs/\n├── week_3/\n│   ├── R/\n│   ├── data-raw/\n│   ├── data/\n│   └── outputs/\n└── week_4/\n    ├── R/\n    ├── data-raw/\n    ├── data/\n    └── outputs/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the Files pane in RStudio (bottom right) to verify that all folders were created correctly.\n\n\nEach week’s folder has:\n\nR/: Scripts and Quarto documents\ndata-raw/: Original, unmodified data\ndata/: Processed, analysis-ready data\noutputs/: Generated reports, figures, and other results\n\nFor this week’s automated reporting project, we’ll use:\n\nweek_1/R/ for our report template and functions\nweek_1/data-raw/ for any raw data we need to process\nweek_1/data/ for cleaned, ready-to-analyze data\nweek_1/outputs/ for our generated reports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can also create folders using the Files pane in RStudio (bottom right) by clicking “New Folder”.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Install & Load Packages\nThink of R packages like apps for your phone:\n\nYou install an app once\nYou open the app each time you want to use it\n\nSimilarly with R:\n\nYou install a package once\nYou load it with library() each time you start R\n\nThere are two main “app stores” for R packages:\n\nCRAN: The official R app store. Like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, packages here go through review and testing\nGitHub: More like downloading apps directly from developers’ websites. Newer features, but less formal review\n\nLet’s install what we need:\n\n# First, install pak - our package installer\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\n\n# Now use pak to install everything else\npak::pkg_install(\n  c(\n    \"quarto\",            # For report generation\n    \"t-emery/chinadevfin3\",  # From GitHub, GCDF 3.0 data package that I made\n    \"glue\",              # For working with text\n    \"tinytex\",           # For rendering pdfs\n    \"here\",              # For relative file paths,\n    \"withr\",             # For file system operations\n    \"fs\"                # For file system operations\n  )\n)\n\n# Special setup needed for PDF creation\ntinytex::install_tinytex() \n\n# If you haven't installed tidyverse yet (from pre-class setup):\n# pak::pkg_install(\"tidyverse\") # Core data science tools from CRAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe c() function combines things together. We’ll use it often!\n\n\nNow let’s load the packages we’ll use:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)      # Load core tools\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(chinadevfin3)   # Load GCDF 3.0 tools\nlibrary(glue)           # Load text tools\nlibrary(here)           # Load relative file paths\n\nhere() starts at /Users/teal_emery/Dropbox/DataScience/data_analysis_for_chinese_debt_data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about the startup messages - they’re just telling us what was loaded.",

    "section": "2.8 Introduction to Quarto",
    "text": "2.8 Introduction to Quarto\nQuarto is a modern scientific and technical publishing system built for the way we work today. Think of it as a powerful document creator that lets you combine your narrative (text), code, and results all in one place. When you make changes to your analysis, everything updates automatically - no more copying and pasting results into Word! You can write once and publish to multiple formats like HTML, PDF, Word, and presentations. It’s like having a Swiss Army knife for creating data-driven documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started Resources\n\n\n\n\nFollow along with the official Getting Started with Quarto in RStudio tutorial\nKeep the handy Quarto Cheatsheet nearby for quick reference\n\n\n\n\n2.8.1 Why Use Quarto?\nQuarto documents are:\n\nReproducible: Code and results stay in sync\nProfessional: Beautiful output in multiple formats\nFlexible: One source, many outputs\nVersion-controlled: Easy to track changes\nShareable: Others can see your code and results\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Real-World Use Cases\nQuarto shines in several different scenarios:\n\n2.8.2.1 1. Lab Notebook / Exploratory Analysis\n\nWrite text and execute code in the same document\nTrack your thought process and decisions\nDocument what worked (and what didn’t)\nKeep a record of your exploration\nThis follows the tradition of “literate programming” introduced by Donald Knuth\n\nHere’s an example of documenting your exploration:\n## Question: Do loan commitments vary by region?\n\n```{r}\n# First, let's look at Africa\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(\"Angola\")\n```\nInteresting spike in 2016. Let's check another country...\n\n\n2.8.2.2 2. Professional Documents\n\nTurn your analysis directly into reports\nCreate presentations\nBuild websites and books\nGenerate multiple formats from one source\n\nIn fact, this textbook itself is written in Quarto! You can see exactly how this page was created by looking at the source code on GitHub: week_1_in_class.qmd\nThis means:\n\nYou can see how we practice what we preach\nYou can learn from the actual code we use\nYou have examples to reference for your own work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs you work through this course, try viewing the source code for different pages. It’s a great way to learn Quarto techniques!\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.3 Your First Quarto Document\n\nClick File → New File → Quarto Document\nFill in:\n\nTitle: “Week 1: Getting Started”\nAuthor: Your name\nClick “Create”\n\n\nYou’ll see a template document with some example content. Let’s modify it:\n---\ntitle: \"Week 1: Getting Started\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    embed-resources: true # Makes HTML easily shareable\n  docx: default\n  pdf: default\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing HTML Documents\n\n\n\nUsing embed-resources: true ensures your HTML document can be shared and opened by anyone. The file will be a bit larger, but this is only noticeable when working with very large datasets. For most purposes, the convenience of easy sharing is worth it!\n\n\n\n\n2.8.4 Basic Markdown\nMarkdown is a simple way to format text that’s easy to read and write. Think of it as a set of formatting shortcuts: instead of clicking buttons like in Word, you add special characters around your text. Here are the basics you’ll see in our example:\n\nUse # for headers (more # means smaller headers)\nWrap words in **bold** to make them bold\nWrap words in *italics* to make them italics\nStart lines with - or numbers for lists\n\nTry this example:\n## About This Course\n\nThis course will teach me to:\n- Create **beautiful** visualizations\n- Write *efficient* code\n- Generate professional reports\n\n1. First, we'll learn about projects\n2. Then we'll explore functions\n3. Finally, we'll create visualizations\nTry toggling between the Source and Visual editors at the top left of your RStudio window. The Visual editor shows formatting like Word, but we encourage using the Source editor to better understand how markdown works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThere’s much more you can do with markdown! Check out the Quarto Markdown Basics guide when you’re ready to explore.\n\n\n\n\n2.8.5 Adding Code\nA code chunk is like a special container in your document where you can write and run R code. Think of it as a mini R console embedded right in your document - anything between the ``` markers will be treated as R code, run by R, and the results will appear right below it. This lets you mix explanatory text with working code and see the results all in one place.\nClick the “Insert” button or press Ctrl+Alt+I (Cmd+Option+I on Mac) to insert a code chunk:\n```{r}\n# Let's do a simple calculation\n2 + 2\n```\nTo run this code, you have two easy options:\n\nClick the small green “play” button ▶️ in the top-right corner of the code chunk\nUse keyboard shortcuts:\n\nWindows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the entire chunk\nMac: Cmd+Shift+Enter to run the entire chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also run a single line by placing your cursor on that line and pressing:\n\nWindows/Linux: Ctrl+Enter\nMac: Cmd+Enter\n\n\n\nSave your Quarto document as week_1_in_class in the week_1/R folder. It will save your Quarto document with a .qmd extension.\n\n\n2.8.6 Rendering Your Document\n\nClick the “Render” button\nQuarto will create three versions:\n\nHTML (great for web sharing)\nWord (for collaborating with non-R users)\nPDF (for formal documents)\n\n\n\n\n2.8.7 Practice Time\n\nAdd a section about what you hope to learn\nInsert a code chunk with a simple calculation\nTry different heading levels (## and ###)\nAdd some bold and italic text\nRender to all formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nKeep this document! We’ll add to it throughout the class.\n\n\nNext, we’ll start adding some real analysis to our document!",

    "section": "2.9 Let’s Start Building: Functions & Pipelines",
    "text": "2.9 Let’s Start Building: Functions & Pipelines\nNow that you’ve seen where we’re headed, let’s build this step by step. First, we’ll learn about two key concepts that make automation possible:\n\nFunctions: Write code once, use it many times\nPipes: Chain operations together clearly\n\nReady? Let’s dive in!\n\n2.9.1 Introduction to Functions: Making Your Code DRY and Error-Free\nOne of the fundamental principles of data analysis is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. When you find yourself copying and pasting the same code multiple times, it’s time for a function. Functions help us: - Write code once and reuse it many times - Reduce the chance of errors from copy-paste mistakes - Make our code more readable and maintainable\nLet’s see this in action with a common task: making large numbers more readable.\n\n# Without a function - repetitive and error-prone\n1734483333 / 1000000000  # Convert to billions\n\n[1] 1.734483\n\n2847594938 / 1000000000  # Have to repeat the calculation\n\n[1] 2.847595\n\n5938273847 / 100000000  # Each repetition risks typos\n\n[1] 59.38274\n\n\nSpot the error above. It’s easy to make, and won’t always be as obvious to spot. Order of magnitude errors are surprisingly common, and quite embarrassing if you catch them afterwards.\nLet’s work hard to be lazy (and accurate), and make a function to do this:\n\n# With a function - write once, use many times\nto_billions &lt;- function(amount) {\n  amount / 10^9 # 10^9 = 1 billion, harder to mess up.\n}\n\n# Now it's easy and safe to convert any number\nto_billions(1734483333)  # Returns 1.73\n\n[1] 1.734483\n\nto_billions(2847594938)  # Returns 2.85\n\n[1] 2.847595\n\nto_billions(5938273847)  # Returns 5.94\n\n[1] 5.938274\n\n\nThis simple function shows us two key ideas:\n\nFunctions take an input and return an output\nFunctions help us do repetitive tasks easily\n\n\n\n2.9.2 Setting Up Our Analysis Tools\nNow let’s set up some more powerful functions for analyzing development finance data. Copy and paste this code block into RStudio:\n\n# Function to calculate yearly commitments for a country\ncalculate_yearly_commitments &lt;- function(data, country) {\n  data |&gt; \n    filter(\n      recommended_for_aggregates == \"Yes\",\n      country_name == country\n    ) |&gt; \n    group_by(\n      commitment_year,\n      flow_class\n    ) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n      amount_constant_usd_2021_bn = sum(\n        amount_constant_usd_2021, \n        na.rm = TRUE\n      ) |&gt; \n        to_billions(),\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n}\n\n# Function to create a visualization\nplot_loan_commitments &lt;- function(data, country) {\n  data |&gt; \n    ggplot(\n      aes(\n        x = commitment_year, \n        y = amount_constant_usd_2021_bn,\n        fill = flow_class\n      )\n    ) +\n    geom_col() +\n    labs(\n      title = str_glue(\"Chinese Development Finance Commitments to {country}\"),\n      subtitle = \"By Flow Class, 2000-2021\",\n      x = \"Commitment Year\",\n      y = \"Commitments (Constant 2021 USD, Billions)\",\n      fill = \"Flow Class\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")\n}\n\nDon’t worry about understanding all this code yet! We’ll break it down later.\n\n\n2.9.3 Your First Analysis Pipeline\nNow we can use these functions to analyze development finance:\n\n# With pipes - clear and readable\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(country = \"Angola\") |&gt; \n  plot_loan_commitments(country = \"Angola\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s read this pipeline using “and then”:\n\nGet the GCDF dataset AND THEN\nCalculate yearly commitments for Angola AND THEN\nCreate a plot showing those commitments\n\n\n\n2.9.4 Why Pipes Make Life Easier\nThe pipe operator (|&gt;) simply takes what comes before it and puts it into the first argument of what comes after it. It’s that simple! Here’s our analysis without pipes:\n\n# Without pipes - like Excel formulas, hard to read and debug!\nplot_loan_commitments(calculate_yearly_commitments(get_gcdf3_dataset(), country = \"Angola\"), country = \"Angola\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how much harder that is to read? You have to read from the inside out, just like those nested Excel formulas that give everyone headaches! The pipe makes our code read like a story - first we do this, then we do that, then we do the next thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Tale of Two Pipes: |&gt; vs %&gt;%\n\n\n\nR has two pipe operators that both do the same basic job - they help make code more readable by passing data through a sequence of functions:\n\n|&gt; is the native R pipe (added in R 4.1)\n%&gt;% is the magrittr pipe (from the tidyverse)\n\nEither works fine, but we recommend using the native pipe |&gt; since it’s now built into R. You can set this as your default in RStudio under Tools → Global Options → Code → “Use native pipe operator”.\nKeyboard shortcut for adding a pipe:\n\nMac: Cmd+Shift+M\nWindows: Ctrl+Shift+M\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.5 Understanding Our Code with AI\nLet’s use Claude or ChatGPT to understand our code better. Try these prompts:\n\nFor our simple function:\n\n\"Can you explain how this function works?\"\n\nto_billions &lt;- function(amount) {\n  amount / 10^9\n}\"\n\nFor understanding the pipeline:\n\n\"Can you explain what each step of this pipeline does?\n\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(country = 'Angola') |&gt; \n  plot_loan_commitments(country = 'Angola')\"\n\n\n2.9.6 Understanding Complex Functions with AI\nNow let’s look at a more sophisticated function. We’ll use AI to help us understand how it works:\nTry this prompt with Claude, ChatGPT, or DeepSeek:\n\n“I’m new to R and trying to understand this function. Could you explain what each line does in simple terms? Please be specific about what each function (like filter, group_by, and summarize) is doing with our data.\n\n\ncalculate_yearly_commitments &lt;- function(data, country) {\n  data |&gt; \n    filter(\n      recommended_for_aggregates == 'Yes',\n      country_name == country\n    ) |&gt; \n    group_by(\n      commitment_year,\n      flow_class\n    ) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n      amount_constant_usd_2021_bn = sum(\n        amount_constant_usd_2021, \n        na.rm = TRUE\n      ) |&gt; \n        to_billions(),\n      .groups = 'drop'\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n2.9.7 Practice Time\nLet’s try some analyses:\n\nUse to_billions() with some large numbers\nModify the country in our pipeline to analyze different countries\nUse AI to help understand any patterns you see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you see an interesting pattern in your visualization, paste a screenshot into your favorite LLM and ask: “Why might [country] show high commitments in [year]?”\nThis is a great way to test the limits of AI. As domain experts, you probably know exactly why commitments spiked in certain years. Compare what the AI says with your expert domain knowledge - you might be surprised by how often it makes confident but incorrect assertions! This is a valuable lesson in both the power and limitations of AI tools.",

    "text": "2.10 Work Smarter, Not Harder: Automating Repetitive Tasks with Map Functions\n\n2.10.1 The Problem: Repetitive Analysis\nLet’s say we want to analyze several countries. We could copy and paste our code:\n\n# Analysis for Pakistan\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(\"Pakistan\") |&gt; \n  plot_loan_commitments(\"Pakistan\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analysis for Ethiopia\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(\"Ethiopia\") |&gt; \n  plot_loan_commitments(\"Ethiopia\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Analysis for Sri Lanka...\n\nBut this is: - Tedious to write - Easy to make mistakes - Hard to maintain - Not scalable (imagine doing this for 100 countries!)\n\n\n2.10.2 A Better Way: Map Functions\nInstead of repeating ourselves, we can tell R to do something for each item in a list. Here’s a simple example using our to_billions() function:\n\n# Some amounts to convert\namounts &lt;- c(1000000000, 2000000000, 3000000000)\n# Instead of:\nto_billions(amounts[1])\n\n[1] 1\n\nto_billions(amounts[2])\n\n[1] 2\n\nto_billions(amounts[3])\n\n[1] 3\n\n# We can just write:\nmap_dbl(\n    amounts,          # The list of values we want to work with\n    to_billions      # The function to apply to each value (no parentheses needed!)\n)\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nThe map_dbl() function:\n\nTakes a list of things (our amounts)\nDoes something to each thing (applies to_billions)\nReturns a list of results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Functions vs For Loops\n\n\n\nIf you’ve programmed before, you might be familiar with for loops. Both map functions and for loops let you repeat tasks, but map functions are often clearer to read and harder to mess up. Compare these approaches:\n```{r}\n# For loop approach\nresults &lt;- numeric(length(amounts))  # Have to pre-allocate\nfor(i in seq_along(amounts)) {      # Need to manage indices\n    results[i] &lt;- to_billions(amounts[i])\n}\n\n# Map approach\nresults &lt;- map_dbl(amounts, to_billions)  # Clear and concise\n```\nWhy tidyverse prefers map functions:\n\nThey’re simpler to read and write\nThey protect your data from accidental modifications (a common pitfall with for loops)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Functions Family\n\n\n\n\nWe use map_dbl() because we know we want numbers (doubles) back\nThere’s also map() for general use, map_chr() for text, etc.\nSee the full purrr map documentation for more mapping functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that when we use to_billions in map_dbl(), we don’t include the parentheses. Think of it as giving R the recipe (the function) rather than the finished dish (the result of calling the function).\n\n\n\n\n2.10.3 Analyzing Multiple Countries\nLet’s apply this to our country analysis:\n\n# List of countries we want to analyze\ncountries &lt;- c(\"Pakistan\", \"Ethiopia\", \"Sri Lanka\")\n\n# First, let's make a function that does our whole analysis\nanalyze_country &lt;- function(country) {\n  get_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n    calculate_yearly_commitments(country) |&gt; \n    plot_loan_commitments(country)\n}\n\n# Now we can easily analyze any country\nanalyze_country(\"Sri Lanka\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# And we can use map to do many countries\n# map(data to work with, function to apply)\nplots &lt;- map(\n  countries,        # First argument: list of countries\n  analyze_country   # Second argument: what to do with each country\n)\n\nLet’s break down what’s happening:\n\nWe create a list of countries\nmap() takes each country and…\nRuns our analysis pipeline for that country\nSaves all the plots in a list\n\n\n\n2.10.4 Why This Matters\nThis approach:\n\nMakes your code more concise and readable\nReduces chances for error\nMakes it easy to add or remove countries\nScales effortlessly (100 countries takes the same amount of code)\n\n\n\n2.10.5 Practice Time\nLet’s try some exercises:\n\nBasic mapping:\n\n\n# Convert these amounts to billions\nbig_numbers &lt;- c(1234567890, 9876543210, 5555555555)\nmap_dbl(big_numbers, to_billions)\n\n[1] 1.234568 9.876543 5.555556\n\n\n\nTry with different countries:\n\n\n# Analyze your own list of countries\nyour_countries &lt;- c(\"Vietnam\", \"Indonesia\", \"Laos\")\nmap(your_countries, analyze_country)  # Simple and clear!\n\n[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[3]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate total commitments:\n\n\n# First, make a function for the calculation\nget_total_commitments &lt;- function(country) {\n  get_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n    calculate_yearly_commitments(country) |&gt; \n    summarize(total = sum(amount_constant_usd_2021_bn)) |&gt; \n    pull(total)\n}\n\n# Then use it with map_dbl\n# map_dbl(data to work with, function to apply)\nmap_dbl(\n  your_countries,        # First argument: list of countries\n  get_total_commitments  # Second argument: what to do with each country\n)\n\n[1] 28.94673 55.18729 21.56447\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Help from AI\n\n\n\nTry this prompt to understand map functions better:\n\"I'm new to R and trying to understand this code. Can you explain what map_dbl does and how it's different from a regular for loop?\n\n```{r}\namounts &lt;- c(1000000000, 2000000000, 3000000000)\nmap_dbl(amounts, to_billions)\n```\n\n\n\n\n2.10.6 Next Steps\nNow that we can easily work with multiple countries at once, we’re ready to learn how to generate automated reports. The same principles we just learned about doing things repeatedly will help us create professional reports for any country with just a few lines of code!",

We can change these values when we render the report.\n\n\nAdd this content to the report template:\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| include: false\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(chinadevfin3)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(here)\n\n# Load our functions\nsource(here::here(\"week_1\", \"R\", \"functions.R\"))\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nThis report analyzes Chinese development finance commitments to `{r} params$country`.\n\n## Visualization\n\n```{r}\n#| label: commitments-plot\nget_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(params$country) |&gt; \n  plot_loan_commitments(params$country)\n```\n\n## Summary Statistics\n\n```{r}\n#| label: summary-stats\ncommitments &lt;- get_gcdf3_dataset() |&gt; \n  calculate_yearly_commitments(params$country)\n\ntotal_commitment &lt;- commitments |&gt; \n  summarize(total = sum(amount_constant_usd_2021_bn)) |&gt; \n  pull(total) |&gt; \n  round(2)\n```\n\nTotal commitments to `{r} params$country` from 2000-2021: \n$`{r} total_commitment` billion (2021 USD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe {here} Package: Making File Paths Work Everywhere\n\n\n\nEver tried opening someone else’s R project and gotten errors like “file not found” even though you can see the file right there? This happens because of absolute file paths like:\n\nWindows: \"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Project/data.csv\"\nMac: \"/Users/YourName/Documents/Project/data.csv\"\n\nThese paths only work on the original computer! Even relative paths like \"../data/file.csv\" can break if you:\n\nOpen your project from a different folder\nShare your code with colleagues\nMove your files around\n\nThe {here} package solves this by:\n\nAutomatically finding your project root folder\nBuilding file paths that work everywhere\n\nInstead of:\nsource(\"../R/functions.R\")  # Fragile!\nUse:\nsource(here::here(\"week_1\", \"R\", \"functions.R\"))  # Robust!\nThis works regardless of:\n\nWhat computer you’re on\nWhere you opened the project\nWhat your working directory is\n\n\n\n\n\n2.11.4 Step 3: Create a Rendering Script\nCreate a new file called week_1/R/render_reports.R:\n\n# week_1/R/render_reports.R\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and pipe operator\nlibrary(quarto)     # For rendering Quarto documents\nlibrary(here)       # For reliable file paths\nlibrary(withr)     # For safe working with file paths\nlibrary(fs)         # For file system operations\n\n# List of countries to analyze\nsea_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"Vietnam\", \n  \"Indonesia\", \n  \"Thailand\", \n  \"Malaysia\"\n)\n\n# Function to render a report for one country\nrender_country_report &lt;- function(country) {\n  # Create output directory if it doesn't exist\n  output_dir &lt;- here::here(\"week_1\", \"outputs\")\n  dir_create(output_dir)\n  \n  # We'll use withr::with_dir() instead of setwd()\n  # It automatically restores the working directory when done\n  withr::with_dir(\n    here::here(\"week_1\", \"R\"),\n    {\n      # Render the Quarto document\n      quarto::quarto_render(\n        input = \"country_report.qmd\",\n        output_file = str_glue(\"{country}_analysis.html\"),\n        execute_params = list(country = country)\n      )\n      \n      # Move the rendered file to outputs directory\n      file_move(\n        path = str_glue(\"{country}_analysis.html\"),\n        new_path = path(output_dir, str_glue(\"{country}_analysis.html\"))\n      )\n    }\n  )\n}\n\n# Create a safer version of our render function that won't error\nsafe_render &lt;- possibly(\n  render_country_report,\n  otherwise = \"Failed to render report\" # What to return if there's an error\n)\n\n# Generate reports and capture results\nresults &lt;- map(\n  sea_countries,\n  safe_render\n)\n\n# Check for any failures\nfailed_countries &lt;- sea_countries[results == \"Failed to render report\"]\nif (length(failed_countries) &gt; 0) {\n  message(\"Failed to render reports for: \", str_c(failed_countries, collapse = \", \"))\n}\n\n\n\n2.11.5 Step 4: Generate Reports\n\nOpen week_1/R/render_reports.R in RStudio\nClick “Source” (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S)\nCheck week_1/outputs/ for your generated reports!\n\nYou should see:\n\nvietnam_analysis.html\nindonesia_analysis.html\nthailand_analysis.html\nmalaysia_analysis.html\n\n\n\n2.11.6 Real-World Applications\nThis approach is incredibly powerful for:\n\nRegular Reporting\n\nWeekly/monthly/quarterly updates\nReports for different stakeholders\nCountry monitoring\n\nAd Hoc Analysis\n\nQuick responses to specific requests\nComparative analysis across regions\nDeep dives into specific countries\n\nQuality Control\n\nConsistent analysis across reports\nEasy to spot unusual patterns\nReproducible results\n\n\n\n\n2.11.7 Practice Time\nLet’s try some exercises:\n\nAdd a new visualization to country_report.qmd\nGenerate reports for a different set of countries\nAdd more summary statistics to the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Organization\n\n\n\nRemember:\n\nR scripts and Quarto documents go in R/\nGenerated reports go in outputs/\nUse relative paths (like \"R/functions.R\" and \"../outputs/\")",

    "text": "3.5 Building Your First Visualization\nLet’s explore relationships between project size, data quality, and other features by building a visualization step by step. We’ll use Esquisse to create the plot visually, then examine the code it generates to understand how ggplot2 works.\n\n3.5.1 Step 1: Basic Scatter Plot\n\nIn RStudio, click Addins → ggplot2 builder\n\n\n\nSelect gcdf_project_features as your dataset\n\n\n\nCreate a basic scatter plot:\n\n\nDrag data_quality to x-axis\nDrag total_amount_bn to y-axis\nClick “Point” in the geometry menu\n\n\n\nClick the “Code” button at the bottom and copy the code\n\n\nTry running this code in R:\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(x = data_quality, y = total_amount_bn) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"#112446\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you understand how Esquisse works, let’s build up our visualization step by step. Just follow the instructions at each stage, and remember to export and run the code to see how ggplot2 syntax matches your visual choices.\n\n\n3.5.2 Step 2: Add Color by Flow Class\nIn Esquisse, drag flow_class to the color box. Export and examine the new code:\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class\n  ) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how color = flow_class was added inside aes(). In ggplot2, aes() is where we map data variables to visual properties.\n\n\n3.5.3 Step 3: Size by Source Count\nAdd a third dimension to our visualization by mapping point size to the number of sources:\n\nDrag total_source_count to the size box\nExport and examine the code:\n\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class,\n    size = total_source_count\n  ) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur visualization now shows several relationships simultaneously:\n\nData quality (x-axis)\nProject size (y-axis)\nNumber of sources (point size)\nFlow class (color)\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Step 4: Dealing with Overlapping Points\nLooking at our plot, you can see many overlapping points. This happens because our data quality scores are whole numbers (0-10), so many projects have exactly the same score. We can fix this by switching to geom_jitter():\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class,\n    size = total_source_count\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is jittering?\n\n\n\ngeom_jitter() adds a small amount of random noise to each point’s position. This helps us see overlapping points without changing the fundamental patterns in our data.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Step 5: Adding Clear Labels\nNow let’s make our plot more informative with proper labels. In the “Labels & Title” tab:\n\nSet Title to: “Larger Chinese Development Projects Have Better Documentation”\nSet Y-axis to: “Project Size (2021 USD, Billions)”\nSet X-axis to: “Data Quality Score”\nSet Color legend to: “Flow Class”\nSet Size legend to: “Number of Sources”\n\nExport and run the code:\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class,\n    size = total_source_count\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Data Quality Score\",\n    y = \"Project Size (2021 USD,\n    Billions)\",\n    title = \"Larger Chinese Development Projects Have Better Documentation\",\n    color = \"Flow Class\",\n    size = \"Number of Sources\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.6 Step 6: Making Project Sizes More Visible\nOur plot has a problem: the huge range in project sizes (from millions to billions) makes it hard to see patterns. Let’s use a log scale for the y-axis:\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class,\n    size = total_source_count\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Data Quality Score\",\n    y = \"Project Size (2021 USD,\n    Billions)\",\n    title = \"Larger Chinese Development Projects Have Better Documentation\",\n    color = \"Flow Class\",\n    size = \"Number of Sources\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Use Log Scales?\n\n\n\nLog scales are perfect for data that spans several orders of magnitude. They help us see patterns across both small and large values. In development finance, where projects can range from $1 million to $10 billion, log scales are essential for clear visualization.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.7 Step 7: Clean Up the Look\nFinally, let’s change the background. In Esquisse’s Theme tab, select “gray”. Here’s our final code:\n\nggplot(gcdf_project_features) +\n  aes(\n    x = data_quality,\n    y = total_amount_bn,\n    colour = flow_class,\n    size = total_source_count\n  ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log10\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Data Quality Score\",\n    y = \"Project Size (2021 USD,\n    Billions)\",\n    title = \"Larger Chinese Development Projects Have Better Documentation\",\n    color = \"Flow Class\",\n    size = \"Number of Sources\"\n  ) +\n  theme_gray()\n\nWarning: Removed 7286 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).",

    "text": "3.7 The Tip of the Iceberg\nUnderstanding this grammar gives you access to ggplot2’s full power. While we’ve created one visualization, the same grammar can create virtually any plot you need. Here’s a preview of common tools you’ll use:\n\n3.7.1 Chart Types and Their Geometries\nGeometries (geom_*) are the shapes we use to represent data. Think of them as different ways to draw your data points. Here are some common ones by task:\nTime Series (showing changes over time):\n\ngeom_line(): Connect points with lines (for smooth trends)\ngeom_col(): Use bars (for yearly totals)\n\n\n# Example: Annual lending trends\nggplot(data) + \n  aes(x = year, y = total_lending) +\n  geom_line()  # or geom_col() for bars\n\nDistributions (showing spread of values):\n\ngeom_histogram(): Show frequency of values\ngeom_boxplot(): Show median, quartiles, and outliers\ngeom_density(): Show smooth distribution shape\n\n\n# Example: Project size distribution\nggplot(data) +\n  aes(x = amount_constant_usd_2021_bn) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nRelationships (showing how variables connect):\n\ngeom_point(): Scatter plots\ngeom_jitter(): Scattered points with small random offsets\ngeom_smooth(): Add trend lines\n\n\n# Example: Project size vs completion time\nggplot(data) +\n  aes(x = amount_constant_usd_2021_bn, y = implementation_years) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Making Adjustments with Scales\nScales control how your data is converted to visual properties. They’re like the adjustments on a camera:\nNumeric Scales:\n\nscale_y_log10(): Handle data spanning many magnitudes\nscale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)): Set axis ranges\nscale_size_continuous(): Control how numbers map to point sizes\n\nColor Scales:\n\nscale_color_brewer(): Color-blind friendly palettes\nscale_fill_manual(): Choose your own colors\nscale_color_viridis_d(): Perceptually uniform colors\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Setting the Look with Themes\nThemes control the overall appearance of your plot, like a visual style guide:\n\ntheme_gray(): The ggplot2 default, good for exploration\ntheme_minimal(): Clean look, great for presentations\ntheme_classic(): Traditional scientific style\ntheme_bw(): Black and white, printer-friendly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the Right Tools\n\n\n\n\nUse geom_line() when order matters (like time series)\nUse geom_col() for bar charts\nUse geom_histogram() to see distributions\nUse geom_boxplot() to compare distributions across groups\nUse geom_point() to show x & y relationships\nUse geom_jitter() to show relationships with lots of overlapping points",
