Just as you don’t need to be a mechanic to drive a car effectively, you don’t need to be a programmer to use R powerfully. This course focuses on giving you practical tools that will immediately enhance your analytical capabilities.\nWe embrace two key advantages that make this possible:\n\nModern Tools: The tidyverse ecosystem transforms R from a statistical programming language into an intuitive data analysis toolkit\nAI Assistance: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as your personal guide, helping you find and implement the right tools for each task",

Everyone learns differently, so we’ve provided options to suit different learning styles. Remember: our course will get you started, but these resources can help you continue your journey.\n\n2.12.1 THE Textbook\nR for Data Science (2e) is the definitive guide to modern data analysis in R, and it’s completely free online. Much of this course’s approach is inspired by this book, but with a key difference: while R4DS teaches concepts using general datasets (like diamond prices and penguin measurements), we’ll apply these same concepts directly to Chinese development finance data.\nThink of R4DS as your comprehensive reference manual. When you want to: - Understand a concept more deeply - Learn additional approaches - Explore beyond what we cover in class - Review fundamentals\nThis should be your first stop. The authors (Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund) have a gift for clear explanation, and the book is constantly updated to reflect modern best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBookmark R for Data Science now - you’ll be referring to it often!\n\n\n\n\n2.12.2 Video Learning\nIf you prefer to learn by watching, check out “R Programming for ABSOLUTE Beginners” (14 minutes). This gentle introduction is perfect if you’re feeling uncertain about where to start.\n\n\n2.12.3 Interactive Learning\nDataCamp’s Introduction to R provides hands-on practice in an online environment with immediate feedback. While DataCamp is generally a paid platform, this introductory course is free. This format worked particularly well for me when I was learning R.\n\n\n2.12.4 Community Resources\nThe R community is known for being friendly and supportive. Here’s where to find help:\n\n#rstats on Bluesky: The active R community shares tips, resources, and help\nR-Ladies: A worldwide organization promoting gender diversity in the R community\nR-bloggers: An aggregator of R-related blogs and tutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ll provide a comprehensive resource list in Chapter X, but these should get you started. The R community’s commitment to sharing knowledge means you’ll never lack for learning materials!",
