95747,228,101,2010 $200 million loan for Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project,China (People's Republic of),Kazakhstan,KAZ,Asia,2010,2014,NA,Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine,1,1,Copper,CDB provides $200 million loan for Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project,"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit. All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled. The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

The scope of the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project included the construction of 22 km of highway and 18 km of access roads connected to the mining production site, the construction of 26 km of railroad, the installation of 130 km of pipelines and 500 km of cabling, the installation of fully automated Production Control Systems, the construction of a 5.5 km long Tailing Dam and related structures, the construction of various permanent buildings (measuring 39.000 m²), and the construction of concrete, steel-prefabricated buildings. The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project’s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m³ of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015. The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project’s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine’s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).",1. The loan’s precise maturity is unknown. For the time being AidData takes the mid-point (13.5 years) of the 12-15 year range. 2.

Then, on December 16, 2011, CDB signed two bilateral facility (loan) agreements with KAZ Minerals Aktogay Finance Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP, which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kazykhmys PLC (Kaz Minerals PLC) — for the Aktogay Copper Mine Development Project: an RMB 1 billion ($158 million) loan agreement (as captured via Record ID#39557) and a $1.34 billion loan agreement (as captured via Record ID#41941). The RMB 1 billion loan tranche (facility) and the $1.34 billion loan tranche (facility) were available to the borrower for draw down over a three year period. The maturity of each loan was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period of each loan was 3 years. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche was LIBOR plus a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB-denominated loan tranche was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). KAZ Minerals PLC provided a guarantee for both loans. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. As of December 31, 2015, the RMB facility was fully drawn down (disbursed). To protect against currency risks, KAZ Minerals swapped the interest basis from a RMB interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis. As of December 31, 2016, the USD facility was fully drawn down. Arrangement fees with an amortized cost of $15 million, were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. The USD facility was repayable in half-yearly installments beginning in March 2018. The 2016 audited KAZ Minerals financial report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.12% and 4.33% (as of December 31, 2016) and 5.12% and 3.93% (as December 31, 2015), respectively. The 2017 report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.60% and 4.54% (as of December 31, 2017) respectively. AidData has used this information to estimate the interest rates that apply to these loans. The initial development cost of the copper mine was $2 billion, with KAZ Minerals seeking to fund the remaining $500 million. The mine was eventually expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually beginning in 2015. The project was comprised of an open-pit mine and an on-site concentrator to produce copper cathode from oxide ore and copper concentrate from the sulphide ore, with molybdenum as a by-product. Alarko was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for the processing plant at Aktogay. BIR provided engineering and consultancy services for architectural, civil, mechanical and electrical works for the project. ABB provided complete electrification and automation solutions and three gearless mill drive systems, while Ausenco was contracted to work on the open-pit mine. China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was awarded the contract for the construction of the sulphide concentrator. Construction began in 2013).

88341,695,304,2019 $800 million loan for Aktogay Copper Mine Expansion Project,China (People's Republic of),Kazakhstan,KAZ,Asia,2019,NA,NA,Aktogay Copper Mine,3,3,Copper,"CDB provides $800 million loan for Aktogay Copper Mine Expansion Project (Linked to Record ID#53580, ID#41941, ID#39557)","On April 26, 2019, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK) signed an $800 million term facility agreement with China Development Bank for the Aktogay Copper Mine Expansion Project. DBK then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a special purpose vehicle called KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP (which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC). The facility (loan) agreement between DBK and KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP was signed on June 14, 2019. The loan matures on November 26, 2034, and bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.2% margin. In November 2019 and December 2019, DBK drew down two tranches of $140 million and $60 million, respectively, and in April 2020 and October 2020, DBK drew down further tranches of $80 million and $100 million, respectively, under the facility (loan) agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the CDB facility agreement was $380 million.   The purpose of this project is to expand the Aktogay mining and processing plant (MPP). In February 2021, KAZ Minerals PLC announced that construction works at the Aktogay copper mine expansion project in Kazakhstan were affected by reduced staff availability in the first half of 2020, however, works progressed according to plan in the second half of the year as COVID-19 related restrictions were eased and the group’s testing and isolation measures enabled shift changes to take place safely.   On June 4, 2021, a sub-loan agreement was signed between Kazakhstan Development Bank and China Development Bank in the amount of $217 million in order to finance the investment project “Construction and operation of a complex for processing gold-bearing primary ores with a capacity of 5 million tons per year” by RG Processing LLP, RG Gold LLP. As of January 1, 2022, $56.5 million has been disbursed through this loan.   Aktogay is a large-scale, open pit mine with a remaining mine life of around 25 years (including the expansion project) at an average copper grade of 0.27% (oxide) and 0.33% (sulphide). It was forecast to produce about 100,000 tons of copper from sulphide ore in 2021, increasing to over 170,000 tons per year from 2022 to 2027 after the second concentrator commences operations. The expansion project is expected to double sulphide ore capacity from 25 metric tons to 50 metric tons per year and add 80,000 tons of annual copper production from 2022-27 (and about 60,000 tons per year from 2028 onwards).","1. This project is also known as the Aktogay MPP Project and the Kaz Minerals Aktogay LLP Project. The Chinese project title is 哈萨克斯坦阿克托盖铜矿项目. 2. According to CDB, as of 2020, it had disbursed $1.34 billion and RMB 1 billion for the Aktogay Copper Mine Project. These disbursements were likely made through the $800 million CDB loan captured in Record ID#88341 and the 3 additional CDB loans captured in Record ID#53580, ID#41941, ID#39557. 3. AidData has calculated the all-in interest rate by adding 2.2% to the average 6-month LIBOR in April 2019 (2.633%). 4. Loan disbursement information can be found in the 2020 DBK Annual Report. 5.

The September 11, 2015 Mining Agreement covered every aspect of the planned mining operations on the Asmara Polymetallic (Copper-Gold) Mine Project, including the timing of the start of development and commercial production, design capacity and production amounts, reporting requirements, royalty calculations, the use of expatriate employees, contractors and sub-contractors, financing and fiscal arrangements, safety issues, community relations, as well as reclamation and closure issues. It granted AMSC exclusive rights to the mineral title and exclusive rights to conduct mining operations within the license areas over a 20 year term. The Emba Derho, Debarwa and the Adi Nefas Mining Licenses were to cover a total area of 19.3 square km, and planned mining operations of the Mining Licenses were based on a feasibility study that was undertaken on May 16, 2013 and amended in March 2014. The September 11, 2015 Mining Agreement also approved the initiation of all of AMSC’s proposed reclamation and closure plans contained in the Asmara Project Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) report, which was completed in January 2014. Then, on November 6, 2015, Sichuan Road & Bridge Mining Investment Development Corp. Ltd. (SRBM or 四川路桥矿业投资开发有限公司) announced its intention to purchase a 60% equity stake in AMSC from Sunridge for $65 million in cash. SRBM also agreed in principle to assume the obligation to pay Sunridge the remaining principal of the deferred payment of $13.33 million owed to Sunridge by ENAMCO. The acquisition, which was facilitated by an RMB 250 million loan from China Eximbank to SRBM, was successfully completed in April 2016. Then, in 2022, China Eximbank signed a $260 million loan agreement [identification number: 2060011022020215403] with AMSC for the Phase 1A of Asmara Polymetallic (Copper-ZInc-Gold) Mine Project. The loan carries a 10-year maturity, a 3.5 year grace period, and an unknown interest rate. SRBM provided a corporate guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan and ENAMCO provided a corporate guarantee for 40% of the face value of the loan. Under Phase 1A, high-grade copper from the Debarwa deposit will be mined via open-pit methods, crushed and loaded into containers, and transported 120 km to the port facility at Massawa for shipping and sale to a smelter in China (a process known as direct shipping ore or “DSO”). Phase 1A officially commenced in June 2022. China’s ambassador to Eritrea, Cai Ge, cut the ribbon to officially mark the start of the project. The Asmara Polymetallic (Copper-Gold) Mine Project (total cost: $500 million) hosts four known deposits at Emba Derho, Adi Nefas, Gupo, and Debarwa. The mine is expected to have a life of 17 years, producing an estimated 381,000 metric tons of copper, 850,000 tons of zinc, 436,000 ounces of gold, and 11 million ounces of silver. The feasibility study for the project demonstrated that mining the four advanced deposits that make up the Asmara Project (Emba Derho, Adi Nefas, Gupo Gold and Debarwa) and processing of the ore at a central location near the large Emba Derho deposit is economically robust with a pre-tax net present value (“NPV”) of $692 million (using a 10% discount rate) and with a pre-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 34%. The post-tax NPV is $428 million with an IRR of 27%. The feasibility study outlined a three-phase start-up mining operation which would begin with Phase 1A of high-grade copper DSO production from the Debarwa deposit, followed by Phase 1B heap-leaching of near surface gold, Phase 2 supergene copper production, then zinc and copper at a full production rate of 4 million tonnes per year. At full production, the mine is expected produce an average annual production of 65 million lbs (29,000 tons) copper, 184 million lbs (83,000 tons) zinc, 42,000 oz gold, and 1 million oz silver over the first 8 years. The life of the mine is 17 years.","1.

92703,3165,703,2021 $68 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor for working capital,China (People's Republic of),Serbia,SRB,Europe,2021,NA,NA,Bor Copper and Gold Mine,7,7,Copper,China Eximbank provides $68 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor for its working capital needs,"In 2016, Serbia’s then Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić told the media he would kneel before Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to urge China’s most powerful companies to take over Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (or ‘RTB Bor’), a Serbian state-owned copper mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia. In 2017, Vučić went even further, pledging that if the government could finalize an agreement, he would celebrate by jumping into the Sava or Danube rivers in front of the media. Then, on September 17, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — a Chinese state-owned mining company — entered into a strategic partnership agreement with the Government of Serbia. Under the terms of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. agreed in principle to purchase a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor for a cash consideration of $350 million. Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also agreed in principle to invest $1.26 billion (inclusive of the $350 million capital increase) in the technological upgrade, expansion or construction of RTB Bor’s four low-grade porphyry type copper (gold) mines — the Majdanpek (MS) mine, Veliki Krivelj (VK) mine, New Cerovo (NC) mine, and Jama (JM) mine — and smelter plant. The acquisition agreement was part of the Government of Serbia’s broader efforts to sell-off indebted state-run companies to help spur growth and relieve pressure on the budget, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. promised to assume responsibility RTB Bor’s outstanding debts (worth approximately $200 million) and keep 5,000 jobs at the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex. On December 18, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. completed its acquisition of a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor. Bank of China provided a $210 million M&A loan to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. to facilitate the acquisition. The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Chinese banks subsequently issued a series of loans to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (塞尔维亚紫金铜业), a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (63% ownership stake) and Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (37% ownership stake). In 2020, the Serbia Branch of Bank of China issued a $200 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor to support its operational needs. The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Then, in 2021, the Paris Branch of China Eximbank and Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor signed a $68 million term facility (loan) agreement (as captured via Record ID#92703). The borrowing terms of this China Eximbank loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds for its working capital needs. It is also known that Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (‘Zijin’) issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Then, in 2022, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China as lead arranger) issued a $278 million ESG loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to support the ‘technological upgrade’ of the copper and gold mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia. By 2021, the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex was generating annual economic output worth approximately 3 percent of Serbia's GDP. In 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor’s business revenue reached about $968 million and its net profit reached $259 million in 2021. According to public data, in 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor had 5,724 employees, and the average monthly salary was 100,000 RSD (900 USD). Both Zijin management and local and national officials often emphasize how the company’s activities benefit the inhabitants of Bor and Majdanpek. The official statistics from the end of 2022 show that the average net income in September 2022 was 76,850 RSD (roughly 690 USD) in Majdanpek and 88,961 RSD (800 USD) in Bor, both of which are higher than the national average net income, which is reported to be 74,981 RSD (approximately 675 USD). However, the higher average incomes in Bor and Majdanpek do not necessarily translate to a higher quality of living for the towns’ inhabitants. For example, even though the Bor municipal government’s budget has increased due to Zijin’s investment, the authorities failed to properly manage the local heating system, resulting in a suspension of heating provision during the winter of 2023 that left private homes, hospitals, and schools unheated at a time when the temperature dropped below zero. When it comes to labour issues, local and workers from outside have faced increasingly different conditions. Before the sale of RTB Bor, a collective agreement was signed that stated that the new buyer would not be allowed to enforce a new collective agreement that gave fewer rights than the current one. This collective agreement expired on June 21, 2021 and Zijin offered a new agreement that drastically reduced the rights of workers and cut their wages. According to the Nezavisnost (‘Independence’) union, Zijin removed a provision guaranteeing the indexing of salaries to the decisions of the Social and Economic Council of the Serbian Government. The company also wanted to enforce work performance scoring to determine earnings at the end of each year—a provision in conflict with Serbia’s Labour Law, which mandates that there must be equal pay for jobs of the same level and the same qualification structure. Also, the unions announced that the company intended to reduce compensation for nightshift, overtime, holiday, and weekend work, decreasing an average monthly salary of 875 USD by 240–330 USD. Union representatives also claimed the collective agreement discriminated against older workers close to retirement by assigning them to the lowest paid jobs—such as, for women, gardeners, and for men, samplers, transport workers, and so on. At the same time, they alleged that Zijin would not hire new workers over 40 years of age. The company denied the union’s claims and said it had already changed its rules of procedure ‘in accordance with a great number of the requests of the trade unions’. Management also noted it had met union demands on holiday and paid leave, increased wages, severance pay on retirement, and other awards, and said that salaries would be increased, not reduced. After negotiations between the trade union, the Ministry of Mining and Energy, and Zijin, new bylaws were adopted that were identical to those in the previous collective agreement, while the collective agreement itself was left to be negotiated between the company and workers. During negotiations, the company unilaterally proposed a new collective agreement that, as the workers and the unions reiterated, would decrease the rights and pay of employees. In late December 2022, after workers protested in front of the company’s central offices, new rules were introduced that did increase workers’ rights to some extent but did not meet other crucial demands. In January 2023, the unions organized a protest walk in Bor, after which representatives told the press that the company was ‘making lists’ of the employees who took part in public protests to intimidate them and discourage others from joining the demonstrations. Later that month, workers from Bor staged an eight-hour blockade of the company’s transportation points, while workers in Majdanpek organized their first protest. In early February, with mediation by government representatives, an agreement was finally reached on a new collective agreement. Far less is known about the conditions for foreign workers, who are presumably from China—though even this is not confirmed. Official figures indicated that, as of March 15, 2023, there were 5,300 Chinese nationals residing in Bor, though this number is likely inaccurate due to undeclared departures and the presence of Chinese nationals who have not formalized their stay in Serbia. As ethnographic fieldwork and experience demonstrates, the majority of foreign workers live in secluded barracks on the outskirts of the towns of Bor and Majdanpek. On several occasions, Serbian media reported on the poor living and working conditions of the workers and their protests during the Covid-19 pandemic. The media also reported on mass street brawls involving Chinese workers employed by the subcontractor Hongda in June 2022. The authorities only became involved after footage of the street fighting went public, in September 2022. According to local media reports, a Chinese citizen suspected of causing the fight had been placed under house arrest, while seven other participants were expelled from Serbia. The acquisition of RTB Bor initially went smoothly and did not trigger any major social conflicts. The earliest protest in front of the headquarters of Zijin was in May 2019 by the inhabitants of Veliki Krivelj, a village endangered by the mine even before the arrival of the foreign investor. The protest was about the environmental, financial, and safety concerns of the villagers in relation to the Cerovo and Veliki Krivelj open-pit mines. The villagers requested the local authorities become involved in the development of the Special Spatial Plan of the Bor–Majdanpek Ore Basin and demanded access to the documentation submitted by RTB to Zijin about their obligations towards village residents. In the city of Bor itself, the first major dissent was related to the increased concentration of PM10 particulates and sulphur dioxide. The Bor smelter, a much celebrated 250-million-EUR investment by the Government of Serbia, was inaugurated in 2014 by Blagoje Spaskovski, then director of RTB Bor, and Aleksandar Vučić, then prime minister. Upon the acquisition of RTB Bor, Serbia Zijin Copper increased production considerably, resulting in significant pollution during the summer of 2019. The first pollution protest was organized in July 2019. A second occurred in October the same year, when protesters blocked access to Zijin’s headquarters in Bor. A politically diverse group of local actors—including city assembly member Saša Stanković from the right-wing Dveri political party, president of the civic association ‘Loud for Youth’ Vladimir Stojičević, and member of the civic association ‘The Choice Exists’ Marko Janjić, together with president of the local branch of the Party of Freedom and Justice Irena Živković—filed a criminal complaint against Bor Mayor Aleksandar Milikić, then minister of ecology Goran Trivan, as well as others from Zijin. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings were limited, and no protests have taken place since March 2020. A particularly grave problem is the amount of arsenic in PM10. Based on readings performed at measuring stations, there has been a noticeable increase in the concentration of arsenic particles in the air since the arrival of the Chinese investor. The target average annual value according to Serbia’s Regulation on Monitoring Conditions and Air Quality Requirements is 6 nanograms (ng) per cubic meter. Although there has been no official explanation for the increase in arsenic concentrations, academic circles see it as a complex issue. In addition to the smelter, the tailings ponds are also considered to be important factors in pollution. Because ore in the Timok metallogenic zone, of which Bor is a part, has higher than usual concentrations of arsenic, any increase in production will release more arsenic into the environment. Zijin Copper continues to increase the capacity of its excavations, as well as the flotation plants, and the smelter. Zijin is now expanding the capacity of the smelter from 80,000 tonnes to 150,000–200,000 tonnes of ore per year. As the head of the Department of Environmental Protection at the Technical Faculty in Bor, Professor Snežana Šerbula, explained: ‘In Bor, we have been poisoned for years because arsenopyrite is an adjoining mineral of the copper ore. The bigger the production in Bor is, [and] the more copper, gold, precious metals we export, the bigger the concentration of arsenic will be in the air.’ Even though it has repeatedly breached environmental laws, Zijin has been fined on only two occasions. In October 2020, Zijin Copper and the company officials responsible were convicted, in the first instance, by the Commercial Court in Zaječar for pollution caused in 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The company was fined 400,000 RSD (3,600 USD), while the responsible person from the smelter facility was fined 50,000 RSD (450 USD). Both parties appealed the ruling, which resulted in a verdict by the Commercial Court of Appeal in November 2021 that deemed the original fine too mild and ordered Zijin Copper to pay 1 million RSD (9,150 USD). The second fine came in 2022, when the Commercial Court in Zaječar fined Zijin Copper 200,000 RSD (1,800 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD) for initiating work on the expansion of the smelter’s capacity without conducting a mandatory environmental impact assessment. In the same process, the company was also found to have carried out activities without an ‘integrated permit’—the most important environmental protection permit in the Serbian legal system. For this offence, the company was fined 250,000 RSD (2,250 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD). The expansion of the Veliki Krivelj (VK)surface mine requires the relocation of the eponymous village, with a population of about 1,300 people, as well as the expropriation of villagers’ land. Locals have complained about the poor communication from the company. In February 2022, the Ministry of Mining and Energy endorsed the plan to relocate the village and, in May 2022, it submitted the resettlement plan to the local community. As if early November 2023, the process of relocation is still in its early stages. Zijin’s expansion of mining operations has met fierce resistance in Majdanpek since June 2022, when the company began blasting Starica Mountain, which forms a natural barrier between the town of Majdanpek and the mine site. Local grassroot activist group Ne Dam/Nu Dau movement installed an improvised camp on the mountain to stop Zijin from what they claimed was illegal blasting that would further endanger the health of the town’s inhabitants. Local activists and politicians outside the ruling party have been requesting in vain clarity about the exact boundaries of the mine. Since the start of the protests, Zijin’s management, local SNS-aligned politicians, and Serbian government officials have argued that they are not ‘blasting’ the mountain, but rather ‘ameliorating’ it to protect the local population. This explanation did not convince the activists, who continued to occupy the mountain over the summer of 2022 and insisted on access to the legal documents on landownership and those relating to mine planning and approval. In September 2022, after a visit by then Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Zorana Mihajlović, who supported Zijin management, the situation escalated sharply. A drilling machine owned by Jinshan Construction, a Zijin subcontractor, was set on fire and its Chinese operator allegedly beaten, which the local police blamed on the Ne Dam/Nu Dauactivists. The police detained the leaders of the protests and charged them with ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’. The activists rejected the charges and argued it was a politically motivated legal prosecution to clear the way for a resumption of blasting on the mountain. The activists’ argument seems to be supported by the fact that this criminal charge has rarely been used in Serbia—even though it could cover widespread phenomena such as hate speech, violence, and instigation of national, racial, and religious hostility. In addition, some activists testified that during questioning they were subjected to police brutality and were forced to sign false statements and confessions. The activists also suffered physical violence on the mountain during the summer of 2022, when they were threatened and harassed by members of a private security company hired by the subcontractor Jinshan. In late December 2022, after not being paid for their work, members of this private security company reached out to the media. They said they had been hired to beat people (reportedly mostly those of Roma ethnicity) who were trespassing on Zijin-owned land and were encouraged ‘to truncheon’ and use force to compel the activists to move their improvised camp 300 meters away, so the company could continue blasting work. As one of the security workers testified in front of the media, they were paid 100 EUR per beating and asked to hand over the videos of the violence to their superiors. At the time of writing in the northern autumn of 2023, the blasting of Starica Mountain continues, with one entire ridge already removed. The Chinese head of the Majdanpek branch of Serbia Zijin Copper stated that ‘the landslide zone of the Mountain Starica is still being treated, but land recultivation has already begun on the parts of the mountain that have been improved’. He also claimed that ‘the mountaintop has already been greened, [and] now the grass there is just like on a football field’. What is still missing are official documents showing the boundaries of the mine, public information and debates about the impacts of removing the natural barrier between the town and the open mine pit, as well as plans for the future of the town. A legal breakthrough for the activists came at the end of June 2023 when a local court confirmed what the activists had claimed from the beginning: that cadastral plot no. 624/1—a large piece of land that includes parts of Starica Mountain and that Zijin had claimed as its own—was owned by the state and not by the Chinese mining giant. In addition, in mid July 2023, the Administrative Court in Belgrade, acting on a lawsuit by the Regulatory Institute for Renewable Energy and the Environment, annulled the decision by the Government of Serbia allowing Zijin Copper to drastically expand the flotation plant capacity of the copper mine in Majdanpek without assessing its environmental impact. As of November 2023, the activists had been released from house arrest and their electronic police surveillance and movement restrictions had ended, but the charges against them for ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’ had not been dropped.","1.

Then, on September 17, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — a Chinese state-owned mining company — entered into a strategic partnership agreement with the Government of Serbia. Under the terms of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. agreed in principle to purchase a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor for a cash consideration of $350 million. Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also agreed in principle to invest $1.26 billion (inclusive of the $350 million capital increase) in the technological upgrade, expansion or construction of RTB Bor’s four low-grade porphyry type copper (gold) mines — the Majdanpek (MS) mine, Veliki Krivelj (VK) mine, New Cerovo (NC) mine, and Jama (JM) mine — and smelter plant. The acquisition agreement was part of the Government of Serbia’s broader efforts to sell-off indebted state-run companies to help spur growth and relieve pressure on the budget, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. promised to assume responsibility RTB Bor’s outstanding debts (worth approximately $200 million) and keep 5,000 jobs at the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex. On December 18, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. completed its acquisition of a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor. Bank of China provided a $210 million M&A loan to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. to facilitate the acquisition (as captured via Record ID#102977). The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Chinese banks subsequently issued a series of loans to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (塞尔维亚紫金铜业), a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (63% ownership stake) and Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (37% ownership stake). In 2020, the Serbia Branch of Bank of China issued a $200 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor to support its operational needs (as captured via Record ID#102978). The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Then, in 2021, the Paris Branch of China Eximbank and Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor signed a $68 million term facility (loan) agreement (as captured via Record ID#92703). The borrowing terms of this China Eximbank loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds for its working capital needs. It is also known that Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (‘Zijin’) issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Then, in 2022, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China as lead arranger) issued a $278 million ESG loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (as captured via Record ID#102983). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to support the ‘technological upgrade’ of the copper and gold mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia. By 2021, the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex was generating annual economic output worth approximately 3 percent of Serbia's GDP. In 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor’s business revenue reached about $968 million and its net profit reached $259 million in 2021. According to public data, in 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor had 5,724 employees, and the average monthly salary was 100,000 RSD (900 USD). Both Zijin management and local and national officials often emphasize how the company’s activities benefit the inhabitants of Bor and Majdanpek. The official statistics from the end of 2022 show that the average net income in September 2022 was 76,850 RSD (roughly 690 USD) in Majdanpek and 88,961 RSD (800 USD) in Bor, both of which are higher than the national average net income, which is reported to be 74,981 RSD (approximately 675 USD). However, the higher average incomes in Bor and Majdanpek do not necessarily translate to a higher quality of living for the towns’ inhabitants. For example, even though the Bor municipal government’s budget has increased due to Zijin’s investment, the authorities failed to properly manage the local heating system, resulting in a suspension of heating provision during the winter of 2023 that left private homes, hospitals, and schools unheated at a time when the temperature dropped below zero. When it comes to labour issues, local and workers from outside have faced increasingly different conditions. Before the sale of RTB Bor, a collective agreement was signed that stated that the new buyer would not be allowed to enforce a new collective agreement that gave fewer rights than the current one. This collective agreement expired on June 21, 2021 and Zijin offered a new agreement that drastically reduced the rights of workers and cut their wages. According to the Nezavisnost (‘Independence’) union, Zijin removed a provision guaranteeing the indexing of salaries to the decisions of the Social and Economic Council of the Serbian Government. The company also wanted to enforce work performance scoring to determine earnings at the end of each year—a provision in conflict with Serbia’s Labour Law, which mandates that there must be equal pay for jobs of the same level and the same qualification structure. Also, the unions announced that the company intended to reduce compensation for nightshift, overtime, holiday, and weekend work, decreasing an average monthly salary of 875 USD by 240–330 USD. Union representatives also claimed the collective agreement discriminated against older workers close to retirement by assigning them to the lowest paid jobs—such as, for women, gardeners, and for men, samplers, transport workers, and so on. At the same time, they alleged that Zijin would not hire new workers over 40 years of age. The company denied the union’s claims and said it had already changed its rules of procedure ‘in accordance with a great number of the requests of the trade unions’. Management also noted it had met union demands on holiday and paid leave, increased wages, severance pay on retirement, and other awards, and said that salaries would be increased, not reduced. After negotiations between the trade union, the Ministry of Mining and Energy, and Zijin, new bylaws were adopted that were identical to those in the previous collective agreement, while the collective agreement itself was left to be negotiated between the company and workers. During negotiations, the company unilaterally proposed a new collective agreement that, as the workers and the unions reiterated, would decrease the rights and pay of employees. In late December 2022, after workers protested in front of the company’s central offices, new rules were introduced that did increase workers’ rights to some extent but did not meet other crucial demands. In January 2023, the unions organized a protest walk in Bor, after which representatives told the press that the company was ‘making lists’ of the employees who took part in public protests to intimidate them and discourage others from joining the demonstrations. Later that month, workers from Bor staged an eight-hour blockade of the company’s transportation points, while workers in Majdanpek organized their first protest. In early February, with mediation by government representatives, an agreement was finally reached on a new collective agreement. Far less is known about the conditions for foreign workers, who are presumably from China—though even this is not confirmed. Official figures indicated that, as of March 15, 2023, there were 5,300 Chinese nationals residing in Bor, though this number is likely inaccurate due to undeclared departures and the presence of Chinese nationals who have not formalized their stay in Serbia. As ethnographic fieldwork and experience demonstrates, the majority of foreign workers live in secluded barracks on the outskirts of the towns of Bor and Majdanpek. On several occasions, Serbian media reported on the poor living and working conditions of the workers and their protests during the Covid-19 pandemic. The media also reported on mass street brawls involving Chinese workers employed by the subcontractor Hongda in June 2022. The authorities only became involved after footage of the street fighting went public, in September 2022. According to local media reports, a Chinese citizen suspected of causing the fight had been placed under house arrest, while seven other participants were expelled from Serbia. The acquisition of RTB Bor initially went smoothly and did not trigger any major social conflicts. The earliest protest in front of the headquarters of Zijin was in May 2019 by the inhabitants of Veliki Krivelj, a village endangered by the mine even before the arrival of the foreign investor. The protest was about the environmental, financial, and safety concerns of the villagers in relation to the Cerovo and Veliki Krivelj open-pit mines. The villagers requested the local authorities become involved in the development of the Special Spatial Plan of the Bor–Majdanpek Ore Basin and demanded access to the documentation submitted by RTB to Zijin about their obligations towards village residents. In the city of Bor itself, the first major dissent was related to the increased concentration of PM10 particulates and sulphur dioxide. The Bor smelter, a much celebrated 250-million-EUR investment by the Government of Serbia, was inaugurated in 2014 by Blagoje Spaskovski, then director of RTB Bor, and Aleksandar Vučić, then prime minister. Upon the acquisition of RTB Bor, Serbia Zijin Copper increased production considerably, resulting in significant pollution during the summer of 2019. The first pollution protest was organized in July 2019. A second occurred in October the same year, when protesters blocked access to Zijin’s headquarters in Bor. A politically diverse group of local actors—including city assembly member Saša Stanković from the right-wing Dveri political party, president of the civic association ‘Loud for Youth’ Vladimir Stojičević, and member of the civic association ‘The Choice Exists’ Marko Janjić, together with president of the local branch of the Party of Freedom and Justice Irena Živković—filed a criminal complaint against Bor Mayor Aleksandar Milikić, then minister of ecology Goran Trivan, as well as others from Zijin. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings were limited, and no protests have taken place since March 2020. A particularly grave problem is the amount of arsenic in PM10. Based on readings performed at measuring stations, there has been a noticeable increase in the concentration of arsenic particles in the air since the arrival of the Chinese investor. The target average annual value according to Serbia’s Regulation on Monitoring Conditions and Air Quality Requirements is 6 nanograms (ng) per cubic meter. Although there has been no official explanation for the increase in arsenic concentrations, academic circles see it as a complex issue. In addition to the smelter, the tailings ponds are also considered to be important factors in pollution. Because ore in the Timok metallogenic zone, of which Bor is a part, has higher than usual concentrations of arsenic, any increase in production will release more arsenic into the environment. Zijin Copper continues to increase the capacity of its excavations, as well as the flotation plants, and the smelter. Zijin is now expanding the capacity of the smelter from 80,000 tonnes to 150,000–200,000 tonnes of ore per year. As the head of the Department of Environmental Protection at the Technical Faculty in Bor, Professor Snežana Šerbula, explained: ‘In Bor, we have been poisoned for years because arsenopyrite is an adjoining mineral of the copper ore. The bigger the production in Bor is, [and] the more copper, gold, precious metals we export, the bigger the concentration of arsenic will be in the air.’ Even though it has repeatedly breached environmental laws, Zijin has been fined on only two occasions. In October 2020, Zijin Copper and the company officials responsible were convicted, in the first instance, by the Commercial Court in Zaječar for pollution caused in 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The company was fined 400,000 RSD (3,600 USD), while the responsible person from the smelter facility was fined 50,000 RSD (450 USD). Both parties appealed the ruling, which resulted in a verdict by the Commercial Court of Appeal in November 2021 that deemed the original fine too mild and ordered Zijin Copper to pay 1 million RSD (9,150 USD). The second fine came in 2022, when the Commercial Court in Zaječar fined Zijin Copper 200,000 RSD (1,800 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD) for initiating work on the expansion of the smelter’s capacity without conducting a mandatory environmental impact assessment. In the same process, the company was also found to have carried out activities without an ‘integrated permit’—the most important environmental protection permit in the Serbian legal system. For this offence, the company was fined 250,000 RSD (2,250 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD). The expansion of the Veliki Krivelj (VK) surface mine requires the relocation of the eponymous village, with a population of about 1,300 people, as well as the expropriation of villagers’ land. Locals have complained about the poor communication from the company. In February 2022, the Ministry of Mining and Energy endorsed the plan to relocate the village and, in May 2022, it submitted the resettlement plan to the local community. As if early November 2023, the process of relocation is still in its early stages. Zijin’s expansion of mining operations has met fierce resistance in Majdanpek since June 2022, when the company began blasting Starica Mountain, which forms a natural barrier between the town of Majdanpek and the mine site. Local grassroot activist group Ne Dam/Nu Dau movement installed an improvised camp on the mountain to stop Zijin from what they claimed was illegal blasting that would further endanger the health of the town’s inhabitants. Local activists and politicians outside the ruling party have been requesting in vain clarity about the exact boundaries of the mine. Since the start of the protests, Zijin’s management, local SNS-aligned politicians, and Serbian government officials have argued that they are not ‘blasting’ the mountain, but rather ‘ameliorating’ it to protect the local population. This explanation did not convince the activists, who continued to occupy the mountain over the summer of 2022 and insisted on access to the legal documents on landownership and those relating to mine planning and approval. In September 2022, after a visit by then Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Zorana Mihajlović, who supported Zijin management, the situation escalated sharply. A drilling machine owned by Jinshan Construction, a Zijin subcontractor, was set on fire and its Chinese operator allegedly beaten, which the local police blamed on the Ne Dam/Nu Dauactivists. The police detained the leaders of the protests and charged them with ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’. The activists rejected the charges and argued it was a politically motivated legal prosecution to clear the way for a resumption of blasting on the mountain. The activists’ argument seems to be supported by the fact that this criminal charge has rarely been used in Serbia—even though it could cover widespread phenomena such as hate speech, violence, and instigation of national, racial, and religious hostility. In addition, some activists testified that during questioning they were subjected to police brutality and were forced to sign false statements and confessions. The activists also suffered physical violence on the mountain during the summer of 2022, when they were threatened and harassed by members of a private security company hired by the subcontractor Jinshan. In late December 2022, after not being paid for their work, members of this private security company reached out to the media. They said they had been hired to beat people (reportedly mostly those of Roma ethnicity) who were trespassing on Zijin-owned land and were encouraged ‘to truncheon’ and use force to compel the activists to move their improvised camp 300 meters away, so the company could continue blasting work. As one of the security workers testified in front of the media, they were paid 100 EUR per beating and asked to hand over the videos of the violence to their superiors. At the time of writing in the northern autumn of 2023, the blasting of Starica Mountain continues, with one entire ridge already removed. The Chinese head of the Majdanpek branch of Serbia Zijin Copper stated that ‘the landslide zone of the Mountain Starica is still being treated, but land recultivation has already begun on the parts of the mountain that have been improved’. He also claimed that ‘the mountaintop has already been greened, [and] now the grass there is just like on a football field’. What is still missing are official documents showing the boundaries of the mine, public information and debates about the impacts of removing the natural barrier between the town and the open mine pit, as well as plans for the future of the town. A legal breakthrough for the activists came at the end of June 2023 when a local court confirmed what the activists had claimed from the beginning: that cadastral plot no. 624/1—a large piece of land that includes parts of Starica Mountain and that Zijin had claimed as its own—was owned by the state and not by the Chinese mining giant. In addition, in mid July 2023, the Administrative Court in Belgrade, acting on a lawsuit by the Regulatory Institute for Renewable Energy and the Environment, annulled the decision by the Government of Serbia allowing Zijin Copper to drastically expand the flotation plant capacity of the copper mine in Majdanpek without assessing its environmental impact. As of November 2023, the activists had been released from house arrest and their electronic police surveillance and movement restrictions had ended, but the charges against them for ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’ had not been dropped.","1.

Upon the acquisition of RTB Bor, Serbia Zijin Copper increased production considerably, resulting in significant pollution during the summer of 2019. The first pollution protest was organized in July 2019. A second occurred in October the same year, when protesters blocked access to Zijin’s headquarters in Bor. A politically diverse group of local actors—including city assembly member Saša Stanković from the right-wing Dveri political party, president of the civic association ‘Loud for Youth’ Vladimir Stojičević, and member of the civic association ‘The Choice Exists’ Marko Janjić, together with president of the local branch of the Party of Freedom and Justice Irena Živković—filed a criminal complaint against Bor Mayor Aleksandar Milikić, then minister of ecology Goran Trivan, as well as others from Zijin. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings were limited, and no protests have taken place since March 2020. A particularly grave problem is the amount of arsenic in PM10. Based on readings performed at measuring stations, there has been a noticeable increase in the concentration of arsenic particles in the air since the arrival of the Chinese investor. The target average annual value according to Serbia’s Regulation on Monitoring Conditions and Air Quality Requirements is 6 nanograms (ng) per cubic meter. Although there has been no official explanation for the increase in arsenic concentrations, academic circles see it as a complex issue. In addition to the smelter, the tailings ponds are also considered to be important factors in pollution. Because ore in the Timok metallogenic zone, of which Bor is a part, has higher than usual concentrations of arsenic, any increase in production will release more arsenic into the environment. Zijin Copper continues to increase the capacity of its excavations, as well as the flotation plants, and the smelter. Zijin is now expanding the capacity of the smelter from 80,000 tonnes to 150,000–200,000 tonnes of ore per year. As the head of the Department of Environmental Protection at the Technical Faculty in Bor, Professor Snežana Šerbula, explained: ‘In Bor, we have been poisoned for years because arsenopyrite is an adjoining mineral of the copper ore. The bigger the production in Bor is, [and] the more copper, gold, precious metals we export, the bigger the concentration of arsenic will be in the air.’ Even though it has repeatedly breached environmental laws, Zijin has been fined on only two occasions. In October 2020, Zijin Copper and the company officials responsible were convicted, in the first instance, by the Commercial Court in Zaječar for pollution caused in 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The company was fined 400,000 RSD (3,600 USD), while the responsible person from the smelter facility was fined 50,000 RSD (450 USD). Both parties appealed the ruling, which resulted in a verdict by the Commercial Court of Appeal in November 2021 that deemed the original fine too mild and ordered Zijin Copper to pay 1 million RSD (9,150 USD). The second fine came in 2022, when the Commercial Court in Zaječar fined Zijin Copper 200,000 RSD (1,800 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD) for initiating work on the expansion of the smelter’s capacity without conducting a mandatory environmental impact assessment. In the same process, the company was also found to have carried out activities without an ‘integrated permit’—the most important environmental protection permit in the Serbian legal system. For this offence, the company was fined 250,000 RSD (2,250 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD). The expansion of the Veliki Krivelj (VK) surface mine requires the relocation of the eponymous village, with a population of about 1,300 people, as well as the expropriation of villagers’ land. Locals have complained about the poor communication from the company. In February 2022, the Ministry of Mining and Energy endorsed the plan to relocate the village and, in May 2022, it submitted the resettlement plan to the local community. As if early November 2023, the process of relocation is still in its early stages. Zijin’s expansion of mining operations has met fierce resistance in Majdanpek since June 2022, when the company began blasting Starica Mountain, which forms a natural barrier between the town of Majdanpek and the mine site. Local grassroot activist group Ne Dam/Nu Dau movement installed an improvised camp on the mountain to stop Zijin from what they claimed was illegal blasting that would further endanger the health of the town’s inhabitants. Local activists and politicians outside the ruling party have been requesting in vain clarity about the exact boundaries of the mine. Since the start of the protests, Zijin’s management, local SNS-aligned politicians, and Serbian government officials have argued that they are not ‘blasting’ the mountain, but rather ‘ameliorating’ it to protect the local population. This explanation did not convince the activists, who continued to occupy the mountain over the summer of 2022 and insisted on access to the legal documents on landownership and those relating to mine planning and approval. In September 2022, after a visit by then Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Zorana Mihajlović, who supported Zijin management, the situation escalated sharply. A drilling machine owned by Jinshan Construction, a Zijin subcontractor, was set on fire and its Chinese operator allegedly beaten, which the local police blamed on the Ne Dam/Nu Dauactivists. The police detained the leaders of the protests and charged them with ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’. The activists rejected the charges and argued it was a politically motivated legal prosecution to clear the way for a resumption of blasting on the mountain. The activists’ argument seems to be supported by the fact that this criminal charge has rarely been used in Serbia—even though it could cover widespread phenomena such as hate speech, violence, and instigation of national, racial, and religious hostility. In addition, some activists testified that during questioning they were subjected to police brutality and were forced to sign false statements and confessions. The activists also suffered physical violence on the mountain during the summer of 2022, when they were threatened and harassed by members of a private security company hired by the subcontractor Jinshan. In late December 2022, after not being paid for their work, members of this private security company reached out to the media. They said they had been hired to beat people (reportedly mostly those of Roma ethnicity) who were trespassing on Zijin-owned land and were encouraged ‘to truncheon’ and use force to compel the activists to move their improvised camp 300 meters away, so the company could continue blasting work. As one of the security workers testified in front of the media, they were paid 100 EUR per beating and asked to hand over the videos of the violence to their superiors. At the time of writing in the northern autumn of 2023, the blasting of Starica Mountain continues, with one entire ridge already removed. The Chinese head of the Majdanpek branch of Serbia Zijin Copper stated that ‘the landslide zone of the Mountain Starica is still being treated, but land recultivation has already begun on the parts of the mountain that have been improved’. He also claimed that ‘the mountaintop has already been greened, [and] now the grass there is just like on a football field’. What is still missing are official documents showing the boundaries of the mine, public information and debates about the impacts of removing the natural barrier between the town and the open mine pit, as well as plans for the future of the town. A legal breakthrough for the activists came at the end of June 2023 when a local court confirmed what the activists had claimed from the beginning: that cadastral plot no. 624/1—a large piece of land that includes parts of Starica Mountain and that Zijin had claimed as its own—was owned by the state and not by the Chinese mining giant. In addition, in mid July 2023, the Administrative Court in Belgrade, acting on a lawsuit by the Regulatory Institute for Renewable Energy and the Environment, annulled the decision by the Government of Serbia allowing Zijin Copper to drastically expand the flotation plant capacity of the copper mine in Majdanpek without assessing its environmental impact. As of November 2023, the activists had been released from house arrest and their electronic police surveillance and movement restrictions had ended, but the charges against them for ‘[jeopardizing] security and instigating national, racial, and religious hatred and hostility’ had not been dropped.","1.

In 2017, Vučić went even further, pledging that if the government could finalize an agreement, he would celebrate by jumping into the Sava or Danube rivers in front of the media. Then, on September 17, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — a Chinese state-owned mining company — entered into a strategic partnership agreement with the Government of Serbia. Under the terms of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. agreed in principle to purchase a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor for a cash consideration of $350 million. Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also agreed in principle to invest $1.26 billion (inclusive of the $350 million capital increase) in the technological upgrade, expansion or construction of RTB Bor’s four low-grade porphyry type copper (gold) mines — the Majdanpek (MS) mine, Veliki Krivelj (VK) mine, New Cerovo (NC) mine, and Jama (JM) mine — and smelter plant. The acquisition agreement was part of the Government of Serbia’s broader efforts to sell-off indebted state-run companies to help spur growth and relieve pressure on the budget, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. promised to assume responsibility RTB Bor’s outstanding debts (worth approximately $200 million) and keep 5,000 jobs at the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex. On December 18, 2018, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. completed its acquisition of a 63% ownership stake in RTB Bor. Bank of China provided a $210 million M&A loan to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. to facilitate the acquisition (as captured via Record ID#102977). The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Chinese banks subsequently issued a series of loans to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (塞尔维亚紫金铜业), a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (63% ownership stake) and Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (37% ownership stake). In 2020, the Serbia Branch of Bank of China issued a $200 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor to support its operational needs (as captured via Record ID#102978). The borrowing terms of this Bank of China loan are unknown. Then, in 2021, the Paris Branch of China Eximbank and Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor signed a $68 million term facility (loan) agreement (as captured via Record ID#92703). The borrowing terms of this China Eximbank loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds for its working capital needs. It is also known that Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. (‘Zijin’) issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Then, in 2022, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China as lead arranger) issued a $278 million ESG loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (as captured via Record ID#102983). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to support the ‘technological upgrade’ of the copper and gold mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia. By 2021, the Bor copper and gold mining and smelting complex was generating annual economic output worth approximately 3 percent of Serbia's GDP. In 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor’s business revenue reached about $968 million and its net profit reached $259 million in 2021. According to public data, in 2022, Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor had 5,724 employees, and the average monthly salary was 100,000 RSD (900 USD). Both Zijin management and local and national officials often emphasize how the company’s activities benefit the inhabitants of Bor and Majdanpek. The official statistics from the end of 2022 show that the average net income in September 2022 was 76,850 RSD (roughly 690 USD) in Majdanpek and 88,961 RSD (800 USD) in Bor, both of which are higher than the national average net income, which is reported to be 74,981 RSD (approximately 675 USD). However, the higher average incomes in Bor and Majdanpek do not necessarily translate to a higher quality of living for the towns’ inhabitants. For example, even though the Bor municipal government’s budget has increased due to Zijin’s investment, the authorities failed to properly manage the local heating system, resulting in a suspension of heating provision during the winter of 2023 that left private homes, hospitals, and schools unheated at a time when the temperature dropped below zero. When it comes to labour issues, local and workers from outside have faced increasingly different conditions. Before the sale of RTB Bor, a collective agreement was signed that stated that the new buyer would not be allowed to enforce a new collective agreement that gave fewer rights than the current one. This collective agreement expired on June 21, 2021 and Zijin offered a new agreement that drastically reduced the rights of workers and cut their wages. According to the Nezavisnost (‘Independence’) union, Zijin removed a provision guaranteeing the indexing of salaries to the decisions of the Social and Economic Council of the Serbian Government. The company also wanted to enforce work performance scoring to determine earnings at the end of each year—a provision in conflict with Serbia’s Labour Law, which mandates that there must be equal pay for jobs of the same level and the same qualification structure. Also, the unions announced that the company intended to reduce compensation for nightshift, overtime, holiday, and weekend work, decreasing an average monthly salary of 875 USD by 240–330 USD. Union representatives also claimed the collective agreement discriminated against older workers close to retirement by assigning them to the lowest paid jobs—such as, for women, gardeners, and for men, samplers, transport workers, and so on. At the same time, they alleged that Zijin would not hire new workers over 40 years of age. The company denied the union’s claims and said it had already changed its rules of procedure ‘in accordance with a great number of the requests of the trade unions’. Management also noted it had met union demands on holiday and paid leave, increased wages, severance pay on retirement, and other awards, and said that salaries would be increased, not reduced. After negotiations between the trade union, the Ministry of Mining and Energy, and Zijin, new bylaws were adopted that were identical to those in the previous collective agreement, while the collective agreement itself was left to be negotiated between the company and workers. During negotiations, the company unilaterally proposed a new collective agreement that, as the workers and the unions reiterated, would decrease the rights and pay of employees. In late December 2022, after workers protested in front of the company’s central offices, new rules were introduced that did increase workers’ rights to some extent but did not meet other crucial demands. In January 2023, the unions organized a protest walk in Bor, after which representatives told the press that the company was ‘making lists’ of the employees who took part in public protests to intimidate them and discourage others from joining the demonstrations. Later that month, workers from Bor staged an eight-hour blockade of the company’s transportation points, while workers in Majdanpek organized their first protest. In early February, with mediation by government representatives, an agreement was finally reached on a new collective agreement. Far less is known about the conditions for foreign workers, who are presumably from China—though even this is not confirmed. Official figures indicated that, as of March 15, 2023, there were 5,300 Chinese nationals residing in Bor, though this number is likely inaccurate due to undeclared departures and the presence of Chinese nationals who have not formalized their stay in Serbia. As ethnographic fieldwork and experience demonstrates, the majority of foreign workers live in secluded barracks on the outskirts of the towns of Bor and Majdanpek. On several occasions, Serbian media reported on the poor living and working conditions of the workers and their protests during the Covid-19 pandemic. The media also reported on mass street brawls involving Chinese workers employed by the subcontractor Hongda in June 2022. The authorities only became involved after footage of the street fighting went public, in September 2022. According to local media reports, a Chinese citizen suspected of causing the fight had been placed under house arrest, while seven other participants were expelled from Serbia. The acquisition of RTB Bor initially went smoothly and did not trigger any major social conflicts. The earliest protest in front of the headquarters of Zijin was in May 2019 by the inhabitants of Veliki Krivelj, a village endangered by the mine even before the arrival of the foreign investor. The protest was about the environmental, financial, and safety concerns of the villagers in relation to the Cerovo and Veliki Krivelj open-pit mines. The villagers requested the local authorities become involved in the development of the Special Spatial Plan of the Bor–Majdanpek Ore Basin and demanded access to the documentation submitted by RTB to Zijin about their obligations towards village residents. In the city of Bor itself, the first major dissent was related to the increased concentration of PM10 particulates and sulphur dioxide. The Bor smelter, a much celebrated 250-million-EUR investment by the Government of Serbia, was inaugurated in 2014 by Blagoje Spaskovski, then director of RTB Bor, and Aleksandar Vučić, then prime minister. Upon the acquisition of RTB Bor, Serbia Zijin Copper increased production considerably, resulting in significant pollution during the summer of 2019. The first pollution protest was organized in July 2019. A second occurred in October the same year, when protesters blocked access to Zijin’s headquarters in Bor. A politically diverse group of local actors—including city assembly member Saša Stanković from the right-wing Dveri political party, president of the civic association ‘Loud for Youth’ Vladimir Stojičević, and member of the civic association ‘The Choice Exists’ Marko Janjić, together with president of the local branch of the Party of Freedom and Justice Irena Živković—filed a criminal complaint against Bor Mayor Aleksandar Milikić, then minister of ecology Goran Trivan, as well as others from Zijin. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, public gatherings were limited, and no protests have taken place since March 2020. A particularly grave problem is the amount of arsenic in PM10. Based on readings performed at measuring stations, there has been a noticeable increase in the concentration of arsenic particles in the air since the arrival of the Chinese investor. The target average annual value according to Serbia’s Regulation on Monitoring Conditions and Air Quality Requirements is 6 nanograms (ng) per cubic meter.

Zijin Copper continues to increase the capacity of its excavations, as well as the flotation plants, and the smelter. Zijin is now expanding the capacity of the smelter from 80,000 tonnes to 150,000–200,000 tonnes of ore per year.

The company was fined 400,000 RSD (3,600 USD), while the responsible person from the smelter facility was fined 50,000 RSD (450 USD). Both parties appealed the ruling, which resulted in a verdict by the Commercial Court of Appeal in November 2021 that deemed the original fine too mild and ordered Zijin Copper to pay 1 million RSD (9,150 USD). The second fine came in 2022, when the Commercial Court in Zaječar fined Zijin Copper 200,000 RSD (1,800 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD) for initiating work on the expansion of the smelter’s capacity without conducting a mandatory environmental impact assessment. In the same process, the company was also found to have carried out activities without an ‘integrated permit’—the most important environmental protection permit in the Serbian legal system. For this offence, the company was fined 250,000 RSD (2,250 USD) and the responsible person 30,000 RSD (280 USD). The expansion of the Veliki Krivelj (VK) surface mine requires the relocation of the eponymous village, with a population of about 1,300 people, as well as the expropriation of villagers’ land. Locals have complained about the poor communication from the company. In February 2022, the Ministry of Mining and Energy endorsed the plan to relocate the village and, in May 2022, it submitted the resettlement plan to the local community.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit. All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled. The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Approximately 42.000 m³ of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015. The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project’s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine’s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).","1.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit. All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled. The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Then, on September 2, 2015, China Eximbank and VEB signed an MOU on the project. The loan carried an 8-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance the $1.378 billion project.   The project consisted of an open-pit mine at the Bystrinskoye deposit; a mining and processing plant (MPP) with all associated infrastructure, including a power line and the 227 km Borzya–Gazimursky Zavod railway line; as well as a rotation camp. Upon completion, the mining and enrichment plant was expected to have the capacity to process 10 million tons of ore per year to produce copper, gold and magnetite concentrates.   Construction of the open-pit mine and the MPP started in 2013. In 2017, a 220 kV power line was commissioned and a camp for 1,047 people was built. Hot commissioning of the MPP started in October 2017. Then, in May 2018, the mine shipped its first consignment of 680 tons of iron ore to China. At that point, the mine was running in pre-commissioning mode. The MPP came online in December 2019. The project was expected to ramp up to design capacity by 2021.  The Bystrinsky GOK faces several environmental challenges, including pollution, biodiversity loss, and soil and water quality degradation. Heavy metals and arsenic contamination from industrial operations impact both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with pollutant zones extending up to 20 km. Habitat fragmentation, expropriation of territories, and natural factors like severe floods exacerbate these effects, threatening local flora and fauna, including 32 protected species. Additionally, elevated arsenic levels in the soil hinder fertility, while dust and aerosol emissions contribute to further degradation.  To address these issues, the facility has implemented advanced technologies, such as ash and dust collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and multi-stage wastewater treatment systems, achieving 92% water reuse. Safe waste management practices include geomembrane-lined landfills with drainage systems to prevent soil contamination. Renewable energy sources like hydropower, which already account for 34% of the energy mix, are being expanded with plans for solar power. The introduction of the Integral Ecosystem Indicator (IEI) enables continuous monitoring of biodiversity health, showing minimal losses in impacted areas. Collaboration with scientists has identified bioindicators, including the Maksimovich vole and Siberian frog, to monitor ecosystem changes effectively. Efforts are also supported by the nearby Uryumkan Nature Reserve, which helps preserve local biodiversity while minimizing industrial impacts. Through these measures, Bystrinsky GOK aims to balance sustainable operations with environmental conservation.  The Bystrinsky GOK also stands as a vital contributor to the region's economic and social development. During the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF 2017), a social and economic cooperation agreement was signed between Nornickel and the regional government to support investment projects and boost the local economy. Once the plant reaches full capacity, it is expected to significantly increase tax revenues, potentially contributing RUB 4.68 billion to regional and local budgets over the next five years and RUB 18.4 billion in the next ten years, subject to favorable market conditions. In addition, Nornickel has committed RUB 3.29 billion to social projects in the region by 2027, focusing on education, healthcare, sports, and environmental protection, with funds managed through the Trans-Baikal Development Fund. The Bystrinsky project, with an investment of RUB 90 billion, has established state-of-the-art production facilities, including concentrators, open-pit mines, and a tailings pit, alongside a 227 km railway to support logistics. This development has created 2,000 direct jobs and an additional 1,500 outsourced positions. Nornickel’s contributions extend to welfare programs, increasing funding from RUB 1.85 billion to RUB 2.4 billion for 2021–2026. Initiatives include significant investments in children's hockey programs, pandemic relief efforts such as medical equipment and ambulances, and ongoing support for education, arts, and social development. These measures, coupled with the plant's efficient logistics and long resource life of over 30 years, underscore Nornickel’s role in fostering sustainable economic growth and community welfare in the Trans-Baikal Territory.","1.

The operation has separate processing facilities for the sulphide and oxide ores. Copper is recovered from the sulphide ores with co-product gold and silver. The oxide ore is treated to recover gold-silver doré. Mining is done by a contractor using a fleet of articulated trucks, rigid body trucks and hydraulic excavators. The mined ore is sent to the appropriate sulphide or oxide ore stockpiles and waste rock to one of the several waste rock disposal piles on the property. Both the sulphide and oxide plants use the same crushing and conveying system. The two-stage crushing system reduces the ore to minus ¾ inch. The sulphide ore is processed through a 1,300 tonne per day flotation circuit using large capacity circular flotation cells followed by a re-cleaner flotation column. Primary grinding is done with a 12' x 14' ball mill with 80% passing 150 microns. A second 11' x 13' regrind mill grinds the rougher flotation concentrate to 80% passing 35 microns. The overflow from the regrind cyclone passes directly to the cleaner cells before going to the flotation column. The concentrate from the flotation column is then thickened and filtered in order to reduce the final moisture content of the concentrate to about 6%. View of processing facilities at Cerro de Maimón Concentrate is trucked to the port of Río Haina on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic where it is loaded and shipped to customers overseas. The oxide ore is processed via grinding in an 8' x 15' ball mill followed by conventional agitated cyanide leaching, counter current decantation thickening and Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery at a rate of 700 tonnes per day. Tailings and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock are deposited in a co-disposal facility designed by Golder Associates. Perilya practices concurrent reclamation at the Cerro de Maimón property. As soon as an affected area is ready for reclamation, previously reserved topsoil is replaced and the area is re-planted with native species grown in the Company's nursery. At mine closure all infrastructure will be removed and affected areas covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. At Cerro de Maimón, Perilya has been working with local government and communities since 2005 in order to meet the Company's environmental and sustainable development objectives. Activities undertaken by Perilya include: Over 80% percent of employees at Cerro de Maimón come from within Monseñor Nouel Province. Perilya is committed to Interior view of sulphide flotation plant building employment and training of people from local communities. The Fundación Mina Cerro de Maimón (the Cerro de Maimón Mine Foundation) has been established as a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving education and healthcare in the nearby villages of El Copey and Las Martinez. Perilya will provide funding for this foundation and the communities will participate in decisions on distribution of the funds. Improvements to the main access road through the villages of El Copey and Los Martinez. Sponsorship of classes in agriculture, accounting, computer skills, concrete block-laying and cookery and nutrition in the local communities. Provision of direct support to churches and schools in El Copey and Los Martinez.","1.

(Cerro Verde) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands N.V., Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX), and Compañía de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A.— signed a five-year, $1.8 billion senior unsecured term loan credit agreement with 22 banks.   Participants in the loan syndicate included Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, SMBC, Mizuho Financial, Credit Agricole, Citi, ING, BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Natixis, SG, HSBC, BBVA, Scotiabank, Intesa Sanpaolo, KfW IPEX-Bank, CBA, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, and ICBC, among others. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., served as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent.   Amounts are expected to be drawn over a two year period to fund a portion of Cerro Verde’s $4.6 billion mining expansion project and for Cerro Verde’s general corporate purposes. The loan is not guaranteed, is subject to amortization, matures in March 2019 and bears interest at LIBOR plus 190 basis points, subject to adjustments based on Cerro Verde’s leverage ratio. The credit facility amortizes in three installments in amounts necessary for the aggregate borrowings and outstanding letters of credit not to exceed 85 percent of the $1.8 billion commitment on September 30, 2017, 70 percent on March 31, 2018, and 35 percent on September 30, 2018, with the remaining balance due on the maturity date of March 10, 2019. As of March 31, 2014, there were no borrowings and no letters of credit issued under Cerro Verde’s credit facility.   Cerro Verde operates an open-pit copper, molybdenum and silver mining complex located some 30km southwest of Arequipa, Peru, equipped with a concentrator and SX/EW leaching facilities. Its mining expansion project involves increasing the concentrator plant capacity to 360,000t/d of ore from 120,000t/d, making it the world's largest concentrating facility. Project implementation commenced in September 2015. The expanded mine is expected to increase annual production to approximately 600Mlb of copper and 15Mlb of molybdenum.  The Cerro Verde mining site faces significant environmental risks, primarily stemming from dust emissions during its production processes. These emissions affect nearby communities in the districts of Socabaya, Uchumayo, Tiabaya, Hunter, and Yarabamba. Monitoring by Peru’s Environmental Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) revealed that fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) frequently exceeded permissible limits under Peruvian law, with daily violations recorded between June and October 2023. These levels are associated with adverse health impacts, including respiratory illnesses such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions. The long-term exposure of local residents has led to increasing cases of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), with dramatic rises noted since 2014, coinciding with the mine's expansion.  Residents, like those in Uchumayo, have repeatedly raised concerns over the pervasive dust settling in homes and the associated health impacts. Despite requests for health screenings and studies, responses from authorities have been delayed, leaving residents without necessary interventions. Independent studies, such as those by the National University of San Agustín, have corroborated excessive pollution levels, further underscoring the persistent risk.  In regards to social risk, workers at Peru's largest copper mine, Cerro Verde, have postponed planned strikes over grievances including extended working hours, insufficient rest days, and inadequate provision of uniforms. They report that the 12-hour shifts, starting at 6:30 AM, require waking at 4:00 AM, adding to the strain of working in a high-altitude, demanding environment.  The Cerro Verde mining operation has implemented comprehensive environmental risk mitigation measures to minimize its ecological footprint and ensure compliance with international and national environmental standards. Key measures include the operation of advanced water management systems, such as the construction of facilities for wastewater treatment to ensure that water used in the mining process is appropriately treated and reused, reducing freshwater consumption. This effort resulted in a significant percentage of water being recycled within their operations. Additionally, Cerro Verde has conducted participatory environmental monitoring programs, engaging local communities and stakeholders in the monitoring of air, surface water, and groundwater quality. These programs build trust and transparency while ensuring that environmental standards are upheld. Biodiversity preservation initiatives include the restoration of affected habitats and careful monitoring of ecological impacts.","1.

International Mining Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — entered into a conditional share acquisition agreement with Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Ivanhoe Mines US LLC, and Crystal River Global Limited (a private company that is legally incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by So Hon Chun) to purchase a 49.5% equity stake in the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project. Then, in December 2015, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd successfully acquired a 49.5% equity stake in Kamoa Holding Limited (KHL) from Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. via Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited for $412 million. Under the terms of the acquisition, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited assumed responsibility for a $169,000,000 shareholder loan (captured via ID#103014) that Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. had previously issued to KHL (which held a 95% equity stake in Kamoa Copper SA — the actual owner of the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project — at the time of the acquisition).Then, in December 2020, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited provided KHL with a $200 million limited recourse line of credit, which was secured by (i.e., collateralized against) the pre-production ore stockpiles to support the Phase 2 concentrator expansion (captured via ID#102968). The line of credit was never drawn down by the borrower. CITIC Metal Co., Ltd. and Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also each provided an advance payment (pre-export finance) facility of up to $150 million ($300 million in total) to be drawn at the election of KHL from June 10, 2021, until May 31, 2023 (captured via ID#102735 and ID#102654). KHL elected to draw down on these Sinosure-backed facilities in June 2021. The Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex comprises a very large, high-grade stratiform copper deposit with adjacent prospective exploration areas, located within the Central African Copperbelt in Lualaba Province, DRC. Kamoa-Kakula lies approximately 25 km west of the town of Kolwezi, and about 270 km west of Lubumbashi. Kamoa Exploitation Licences (exploitation permits 12873, 13025 and 13026 which cover an area of 397.4 km2), approved on August 20, 2012, grant Kamoa Copper SA the right to explore for, develop and exploit copper and other minerals for an initial 30-year term, expiring August 19, 2042. The permits can then be extended for 15-year periods, until the end of the mine’s life. Title to the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex resides with Kamoa Copper SA, a subsidiary of KHL, which is the holder of the Kamoa Exploitation Licences. The development of the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex was to be undertaken in three phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of a 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant. Phase 2 involved the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa. Phase 3 involves the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 7.6-Mtpa to at least 11.4-Mtpa. China Nerin Engineering Co., Ltd. was one of the contractors responsible for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Kamoa Copper SA relied on best-in-class, mechanized underground mining equipment from Swedish companies Sandvik AB and Epiroc AB, and Finnish company Normet Oy, three of the world’s leading suppliers. The Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN), the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) and Standard Bank South Africa conducted environmental and social due diligence of the project based on an existing Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The project also developed an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) with the purpose of managing identified risks in line with international standards. A Phase 1 groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2019. Phase 1 reached completion in early July 2021 when the 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant was fully operational and copper concentrate was being dispatched daily to the Lualaba Copper Smelter (LCS) and first blister copper ingots had been received. At that time, Kamoa Copper SA was preparing for final plant performance tests, which would conclude the C4 (or “hot”) commissioning activities. The engineering and procurement activities the Phase 2 expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa were also more than 80% complete and on track for a Q3 2022 start-up. In August 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that copper production exceeded 500 tons per day towards the end of July 2021, nearing the Phase 1 steady-state design capacity of approximately 550 tons per day. Phase 1 concentrator copper recoveries averaged approximately 81% during July 2021, with operations progressively increasing toward the Phase 1 steady-state design copper recoveries of approximately 86%. Then, in November 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 1 concentrator plant met, or exceeded, all design criteria and was operating at steady-state. There was a record 18,270 tons of copper in concentrate produced in November 2021, bringing year-to-date production to more than 87,000 tons as at November 30, 2021. In October 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that construction of the Phase 2 concentrator plant was proceeding ahead of schedule and was anticipated to begin operations in Q2 2022. Then, in December 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was approximately 70% complete and it was still on track to begin operations in Q2 2022. In late January 2022, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was expected to be 93% complete by January 31, 2022, with hot commissioning of the concentrator on track to begin in April 2022, several months ahead of the original schedule. A dedicated engineering team was appointed to de-bottleneck both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 concentrators (after commissioning), with targeted improvements aimed at increasing plant throughput from the design of 7.6-Mtpa to 9.2-Mtpa, and producing up to 450,000 tons per annum of copper in concentrate from the first two plants once steady-state was achieved. Then, on March 21, 2022, the Phase 2 concentrator plant successfully produced the first batch of copper concentrate, about 4 months ahead of the original plan. After 17 days of the mills being in operation, the capacity exceeded the design on a consistent basis, and commercial production was officially realized on April 7, 2022. On April 8, 2022, the single day production record was broken, of which 25,126 tons of ore was processed and 1,202 tons of copper was produced. Then, in early June 2022, Kamoa Copper S announced that it had achieved record monthly copper production of 29,800 tons. The Phase 2 concentrator ramped up to steady state ahead of schedule and a milling record of 660,000 tons of ore was achieved in May 2022 – a run rate of 8 million tons per year.","1. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 2.

International Mining Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — entered into a conditional share acquisition agreement with Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Ivanhoe Mines US LLC, and Crystal River Global Limited (a private company that is legally incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by So Hon Chun) to purchase a 49.5% equity stake in the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project. Then, in December 2015, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd successfully acquired a 49.5% equity stake in Kamoa Holding Limited (KHL) from Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. via Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited for $412 million. Under the terms of the acquisition, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited assumed responsibility for a $169,000,000 shareholder loan (captured via ID#103014) that Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. had previously issued to KHL (which held a 95% equity stake in Kamoa Copper SA — the actual owner of the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project — at the time of the acquisition).Then, in December 2020, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited provided KHL with a $200 million limited recourse line of credit, which was secured by (i.e., collateralized against) the pre-production ore stockpiles to support the Phase 2 concentrator expansion (captured via ID#102968). The line of credit was never drawn down by the borrower. CITIC Metal Co., Ltd. and Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also each provided an advance payment (pre-export finance) facility of up to $150 million ($300 million in total) to be drawn at the election of KHL from June 10, 2021, until May 31, 2023 (captured via ID#102735 and ID#102654). KHL elected to draw down on these Sinosure-backed facilities in June 2021. The Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex comprises a very large, high-grade stratiform copper deposit with adjacent prospective exploration areas, located within the Central African Copperbelt in Lualaba Province, DRC. Kamoa-Kakula lies approximately 25 km west of the town of Kolwezi, and about 270 km west of Lubumbashi. Kamoa Exploitation Licences (exploitation permits 12873, 13025 and 13026 which cover an area of 397.4 km2), approved on August 20, 2012, grant Kamoa Copper SA the right to explore for, develop and exploit copper and other minerals for an initial 30-year term, expiring August 19, 2042. The permits can then be extended for 15-year periods, until the end of the mine’s life. Title to the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex resides with Kamoa Copper SA, a subsidiary of KHL, which is the holder of the Kamoa Exploitation Licences. The development of the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex was to be undertaken in three phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of a 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant. Phase 2 involved the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa. Phase 3 involves the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 7.6-Mtpa to at least 11.4-Mtpa. China Nerin Engineering Co., Ltd. was one of the contractors responsible for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Kamoa Copper SA relied on best-in-class, mechanized underground mining equipment from Swedish companies Sandvik AB and Epiroc AB, and Finnish company Normet Oy, three of the world’s leading suppliers. The Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN), the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) and Standard Bank South Africa conducted environmental and social due diligence of the project based on an existing Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The project also developed an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) with the purpose of managing identified risks in line with international standards. A Phase 1 groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2019. Phase 1 reached completion in early July 2021 when the 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant was fully operational and copper concentrate was being dispatched daily to the Lualaba Copper Smelter (LCS) and first blister copper ingots had been received. At that time, Kamoa Copper SA was preparing for final plant performance tests, which would conclude the C4 (or “hot”) commissioning activities. The engineering and procurement activities the Phase 2 expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa were also more than 80% complete and on track for a Q3 2022 start-up. In August 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that copper production exceeded 500 tons per day towards the end of July 2021, nearing the Phase 1 steady-state design capacity of approximately 550 tons per day. Phase 1 concentrator copper recoveries averaged approximately 81% during July 2021, with operations progressively increasing toward the Phase 1 steady-state design copper recoveries of approximately 86%. Then, in November 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 1 concentrator plant met, or exceeded, all design criteria and was operating at steady-state. There was a record 18,270 tons of copper in concentrate produced in November 2021, bringing year-to-date production to more than 87,000 tons as at November 30, 2021. In October 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that construction of the Phase 2 concentrator plant was proceeding ahead of schedule and was anticipated to begin operations in Q2 2022. Then, in December 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was approximately 70% complete and it was still on track to begin operations in Q2 2022. In late January 2022, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was expected to be 93% complete by January 31, 2022, with hot commissioning of the concentrator on track to begin in April 2022, several months ahead of the original schedule. A dedicated engineering team was appointed to de-bottleneck both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 concentrators (after commissioning), with targeted improvements aimed at increasing plant throughput from the design of 7.6-Mtpa to 9.2-Mtpa, and producing up to 450,000 tons per annum of copper in concentrate from the first two plants once steady-state was achieved. Then, on March 21, 2022, the Phase 2 concentrator plant successfully produced the first batch of copper concentrate, about 4 months ahead of the original plan. After 17 days of the mills being in operation, the capacity exceeded the design on a consistent basis, and commercial production was officially realized on April 7, 2022. On April 8, 2022, the single day production record was broken, of which 25,126 tons of ore was processed and 1,202 tons of copper was produced. Then, in early June 2022, Kamoa Copper S announced that it had achieved record monthly copper production of 29,800 tons. The Phase 2 concentrator ramped up to steady state ahead of schedule and a milling record of 660,000 tons of ore was achieved in May 2022 – a run rate of 8 million tons per year.","1.

Kamoa Exploitation Licences (exploitation permits 12873, 13025 and 13026 which cover an area of 397.4 km2), approved on August 20, 2012, grant Kamoa Copper SA the right to explore for, develop and exploit copper and other minerals for an initial 30-year term, expiring August 19, 2042. The permits can then be extended for 15-year periods, until the end of the mine’s life. Title to the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex resides with Kamoa Copper SA, a subsidiary of KHL, which is the holder of the Kamoa Exploitation Licences. The development of the Kamoa-Kakula copper-cobalt mine complex was to be undertaken in three phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of a 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant. Phase 2 involved the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa. Phase 3 involves the expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 7.6-Mtpa to at least 11.4-Mtpa. China Nerin Engineering Co., Ltd. was one of the contractors responsible for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Kamoa Copper SA relied on best-in-class, mechanized underground mining equipment from Swedish companies Sandvik AB and Epiroc AB, and Finnish company Normet Oy, three of the world’s leading suppliers. The Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN), the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) and Standard Bank South Africa conducted environmental and social due diligence of the project based on an existing Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The project also developed an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) with the purpose of managing identified risks in line with international standards. A Phase 1 groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2019. Phase 1 reached completion in early July 2021 when the 3.8-Mtpa concentrator plant was fully operational and copper concentrate was being dispatched daily to the Lualaba Copper Smelter (LCS) and first blister copper ingots had been received. At that time, Kamoa Copper SA was preparing for final plant performance tests, which would conclude the C4 (or “hot”) commissioning activities. The engineering and procurement activities the Phase 2 expansion of the capacity of the concentrator plant from 3.8-Mtpa to 7.6-Mtpa were also more than 80% complete and on track for a Q3 2022 start-up. In August 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that copper production exceeded 500 tons per day towards the end of July 2021, nearing the Phase 1 steady-state design capacity of approximately 550 tons per day. Phase 1 concentrator copper recoveries averaged approximately 81% during July 2021, with operations progressively increasing toward the Phase 1 steady-state design copper recoveries of approximately 86%. Then, in November 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 1 concentrator plant met, or exceeded, all design criteria and was operating at steady-state. There was a record 18,270 tons of copper in concentrate produced in November 2021, bringing year-to-date production to more than 87,000 tons as at November 30, 2021. In October 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that construction of the Phase 2 concentrator plant was proceeding ahead of schedule and was anticipated to begin operations in Q2 2022. Then, in December 2021, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was approximately 70% complete and it was still on track to begin operations in Q2 2022. In late January 2022, Kamoa Copper SA announced that the Phase 2 concentrator plant was expected to be 93% complete by January 31, 2022, with hot commissioning of the concentrator on track to begin in April 2022, several months ahead of the original schedule. A dedicated engineering team was appointed to de-bottleneck both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 concentrators (after commissioning), with targeted improvements aimed at increasing plant throughput from the design of 7.6-Mtpa to 9.2-Mtpa, and producing up to 450,000 tons per annum of copper in concentrate from the first two plants once steady-state was achieved. Then, on March 21, 2022, the Phase 2 concentrator plant successfully produced the first batch of copper concentrate, about 4 months ahead of the original plan. After 17 days of the mills being in operation, the capacity exceeded the design on a consistent basis, and commercial production was officially realized on April 7, 2022. On April 8, 2022, the single day production record was broken, of which 25,126 tons of ore was processed and 1,202 tons of copper was produced. Then, in early June 2022, Kamoa Copper S announced that it had achieved record monthly copper production of 29,800 tons. The Phase 2 concentrator ramped up to steady state ahead of schedule and a milling record of 660,000 tons of ore was achieved in May 2022 – a run rate of 8 million tons per year.","1. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 2.

International Mining Company Limited provides $169 million shareholder loan for Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Acquisition Project,"On May 26, 2015, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. and Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. — entered into a conditional share acquisition agreement with Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Ivanhoe Mines US LLC, and Crystal River Global Limited (a private company that is legally incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by So Hon Chun) to purchase a 49.5% equity stake in the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project. Then, in December 2015, Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd successfully acquired a 49.5% equity stake in Kamoa Holding Limited (KHL) from Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. via Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited for $412 million. After the acquisition, Ivanhoe Mines retained a 49.5% equity stake and Crystal River Global Limited retained a 1% equity stake. Under the terms of the acquisition, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited assumed responsibility for a $169,000,000 shareholder loan (captured via ID#103014) that Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. had previously issued to KHL (which held a 95% equity stake in Kamoa Copper SA — the actual owner of the Kamoa-Kakula Copper-Cobalt Mine Project — at the time of the acquisition). Then, in December 2020, Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited provided KHL with a $200 million limited recourse line of credit, which was secured by (i.e., collateralized against) the pre-production ore stockpiles to support the Phase 2 concentrator expansion (captured via ID#102968). The line of credit was never drawn down by the borrower. CITIC Metal Co., Ltd. and Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. also each provided an advance payment (pre-export finance) facility of up to $150 million ($300 million in total) to be drawn at the election of KHL from June 10, 2021, until May 31, 2023 (captured via ID#102735 and ID#102654).

(formerly known as China National Gold Group Corporation) acquired a 100% ownership stake in Kuru-Tegerek Copper-Gold deposit via Kichi-Chaarat Closed Joint Stock Company. Then, in January 2013, China National Gold Group Co., Ltd. sold a 16% ownership stake in Kichi-Chaarat Closed Joint Stock Company to China CAMC Engineering Hong Kong Co Ltd.   On September 13, 2016, Skyland Mining (BVI) Limited entered into a $30 million loan agreement with Kichi-Chaarat Closed Joint Stock Company (Kichi Chaarat CISC) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China National Gold Group Corporation (CNGC) [84% ownership stake] and China CAMC Engineering Hong Kong Co Ltd [16% ownership stake] that is legally incorporated in the Kyrgyz Republic — for the Kuru-Tegerek Copper and Gold Resources Development Project. The loan's original maturity date was July 10, 2017. However, on July 31, 2017, the maturity of the loan from Skyland Mining (BVI) Limited was extended from July 10, 2017 to July 31, 2017 and the was fully settled on July 31, 2017.   On July 24, 2017, China Eximbank signed a loan agreement with Kichi-Chaarat Closed Joint Stock Company for the Kuru-Tegerek Copper and Gold Resources Development Project. No sovereign guarantee was provided by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic in support of the loan. The total cost of the project was $220 million; however, the face value of the China Eximbank loan that supported the project is unknown.   The purpose of the project was to develop the Kuru-Tegerek copper and gold mine in Chatkal district and the Jalal-Abad oblast of Kyrgyzstan. Upon completion, the mine was expected to have an annual processing capacity of about 1.8 million tons, including an annual output of 11,000 tons of copper, 600 kg of gold and 4.6 tons of silver. The annual sales income from the mine was expected to be $100 million. The mine was also expected to be the largest copper-gold mine and the largest underground mine in Kyrgyzstan.   Construction began in 2014 and the mine was official put into operation (production) on August 14, 2019. The project reportedly generated 74 jobs for Chinese employees and 347 jobs for Kyrgyz employees.  The Kuru-Tegerek Project in Kyrgyzstan faces significant environmental hazards, including water contamination from toxic runoff and chemical spills, air pollution from dust and particulate matter, soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and risks associated with tailings storage facilities (TSFs). To mitigate these risks, the project has implemented environmental assessments, stringent monitoring, and advanced waste management systems. Measures include controlling runoff to prevent water pollution, minimizing dust emissions to maintain air quality, and securely containing tailings to avoid leaks or spills. Efforts are also made to preserve biodiversity through habitat management and limit ecosystem disruption. These actions are aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the mining operations while ensuring compliance with national and international environmental standards.","1.

55427,2038,2002,2014 $969 million syndicated loan for acquisition of Las Bambas Copper Project,China (People's Republic of),Peru,PER,America,2014,NA,2014,Las Bambas Copper Mine,20,20,Copper,"CDB contributes to $969 million syndicated loan for acquisition of Las Bambas Copper Project (Linked to Record ID98874, #98875, #98876, #98780, #98781, #98783, #55426)","In 2014, Minera Las Bambas S.A.C -- a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of MMG (62.5%), GUOXIN International Investment Group Ltd. (22.5%) and CITIC Metal Co. Ltd. (15%) -- entered into an acquisition facility agreement with the China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, ICBC and Bank of China for a syndicated loan worth $969 million for the MMG's acquisition of the Las Bambas Copper Project. China Development Bank was the leading bank and responsible for about 50% of the loan (captured in Record ID#55427). The co-leading bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was responsible for about 30% of the loan (captured in Record ID#98781). Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China were each responsible for about 10% of the loan (captured in Record ID#98783 and #98780). The loan carried an interest rate set at 6 month LIBOR (.329% according to global-rates.com) + an undisclosed margin (not exceeding 350 basis points per annum) and was to be paid back over 7 years. The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) share security over the entire share capital of MMG South America Management Co Ltd and each of its subsidiaries including Minera Las Bambas S.A. (“MLB”), a debenture over the assets of MMG South America Management Co Ltd, an assets pledge agreement and production unit mortgage in respect of all of the assets of MLB, assignments of shareholder loans between MMG South America Management Co Ltd and its subsidiaries and security agreements over bank accounts of MLB. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to support a $5.8 billion acquisition of the Las Bambas copper mine. There is evidence that the loan fully disbursed. As of 2014, the borrower had utilized (""drawn down) the entire $969 million acquisition facility. The Las Bambas Project is a world class copper development project located in Peru, in the provinces of Cotabambas and Grau in the districts of Challhuahuacho, Tambobamba and Coyllurqui, province of Cotabambas, and in the district of Progreso, province of Grau, region of Apurímac, 72 km from Cusco. The Las Bambas Project tenements include approximately 35,000 Ha of land, of which less than 10% has been explored for additional resources. The estimated mine life is over 20 years and further exploration could potentially increase this. The Las Bambas Project is within the Andahuaylas-Yauri copper belt, which hosts the Antapaccay and Constancia copper mines. The project was approved by Xstrata plc’s Board in July 2010. Its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was approved in March 2011. The project’s main construction permit was issued on May 31, 2012. Mass earthworks started on June 1, 2012. The first 50 km of heavy haul road was put into service on September 15, 2012. The first permanent concrete poured (Flotation Area Tower Crane) was poured in August 2012. The project had achieved a 19% completion rate as of October 2012. MMG completed its acquisition of the Las Bambas mine in August 2014. Mine development began in August 2015 and commercial production began on July 1, 2016. The mine has resulted in multiple environmental conflicts between 2015 and 2022. About 15,000 people protested the mine during the early phases of construction, resulting in clashes with police who shot and killed four local people. There were continued protests in 2021-2022, when protestors blockaded the mine and complained that they received few benefits from the mine.","1. AidData calculated the interest rate by taking the 2014 average 6-month LIBOR (0.329%) and adding it to 350 basis points (3.5%). However, it should be noted that the exact margin is unknown other than that it did not exceed 350 basis points per annum.2. MMG is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China’s Guoxin International Investment. 3. This transaction is not a duplicate of Record ID#55426. Record ID#55426 is a project facility, and Record ID#55427 is an acquisition facility. 4. In August 2004, XSchweiz was awarded the rights to explore and the option to develop Las Bambas through the privatisation process run by the government of Peru. The privatisation process was conducted through an international bid process run by ProInversion. XSchweiz was the successful bidder and was awarded certain rights in relation to the Las Bambas Project, including an option to develop the Las Bambas Project (the “Option”). XSchweiz subsequently appointed XPERU (as its local subsidiary) to be the holder of the Option on 1 October 2004 for a term of five years, with the ability to extend for an additional year. In 2007, XPERU assigned the Option to XTintaya and XTintaya exercised its Option right in August 2010 and entered into a transfer agreement, dated 2 September 2010, pursuant to which it acquired the Las Bambas Project for US$45.5 million plus US$0.5 million and US$0.75 million for each six-month period in year five and year six of the Option, respectively. XTintaya subsequently assigned the Las Bambas Project to the Minera Las Bambas S.A.C. on 1 January 2011.

The Las Bambas Project tenements include approximately 35,000 Ha of land, of which less than 10% has been explored for additional resources. The estimated mine life is over 20 years and further exploration could potentially increase this. The Las Bambas Project is within the Andahuaylas-Yauri copper belt, which hosts the Antapaccay and Constancia copper mines. The project was approved by Xstrata plc’s Board in July 2010. Its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was approved in March 2011. The project’s main construction permit was issued on May 31, 2012. Mass earthworks started on June 1, 2012. The first 50 km of heavy haul road was put into service on September 15, 2012. The first permanent concrete poured (Flotation Area Tower Crane) was poured in August 2012. The project had achieved a 19% completion rate as of October 2012. MMG completed its acquisition of the Las Bambas mine in August 2014. Mine development began in August 2015 and commercial production began on July 1, 2016. The mine has resulted in multiple environmental conflicts between 2015 and 2022. About 15,000 people protested the mine during the early phases of construction, resulting in clashes with police who shot and killed four local people. There were continued protests in 2021-2022, when protestors blockaded the mine and complained that they received few benefits from the mine.","1.

(22.5%) and CITIC Metal Co. Ltd. (15%) -- entered into an acquisition facility agreement with the China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, ICBC and Bank of China for a syndicated loan worth $969 million for the MMG's acquisition of the Las Bambas Copper Project. China Development Bank was the leading bank and responsible for about 50% of the loan (captured in Record ID#55427). The co-leading bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was responsible for about 30% of the loan (captured in Record ID#98781). Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China were each responsible for about 10% of the loan (captured in Record ID#98783 and #98780). The loan carried an interest rate set at 6 month LIBOR (.329% according to global-rates.com) + an undisclosed margin (not exceeding 350 basis points per annum) and was to be paid back over 7 years. The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) share security over the entire share capital of MMG South America Management Co Ltd and each of its subsidiaries including Minera Las Bambas S.A. (“MLB”), a debenture over the assets of MMG South America Management Co Ltd, an assets pledge agreement and production unit mortgage in respect of all of the assets of MLB, assignments of shareholder loans between MMG South America Management Co Ltd and its subsidiaries and security agreements over bank accounts of MLB. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to support a $5.8 billion acquisition of the Las Bambas copper mine. There is evidence that the loan fully disbursed. As of 2014, the borrower had utilized (""drawn down) the entire $969 million acquisition facility. The Las Bambas Project is a world class copper development project located in Peru, in the provinces of Cotabambas and Grau in the districts of Challhuahuacho, Tambobamba and Coyllurqui, province of Cotabambas, and in the district of Progreso, province of Grau, region of Apurímac, 72 km from Cusco. The Las Bambas Project tenements include approximately 35,000 Ha of land, of which less than 10% has been explored for additional resources. The estimated mine life is over 20 years and further exploration could potentially increase this. The Las Bambas Project is within the Andahuaylas-Yauri copper belt, which hosts the Antapaccay and Constancia copper mines. The project was approved by Xstrata plc’s Board in July 2010. Its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was approved in March 2011. The project’s main construction permit was issued on May 31, 2012. Mass earthworks started on June 1, 2012. The first 50 km of heavy haul road was put into service on September 15, 2012. The first permanent concrete poured (Flotation Area Tower Crane) was poured in August 2012. The project had achieved a 19% completion rate as of October 2012. MMG completed its acquisition of the Las Bambas mine in August 2014. Mine development began in August 2015 and commercial production began on July 1, 2016. The mine has resulted in multiple environmental conflicts between 2015 and 2022. About 15,000 people protested the mine during the early phases of construction, resulting in clashes with police who shot and killed four local people. There were continued protests in 2021-2022, when protestors blockaded the mine and complained that they received few benefits from the mine.","1. AidData calculated the interest rate by taking the 2014 average 6-month LIBOR (0.329%) and adding it to 350 basis points (3.5%). However, it should be noted that the exact margin is unknown other than that it did not exceed 350 basis points per annum.2. MMG is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China’s Guoxin International Investment.3. This transaction is not a duplicate of Record ID#55426. Record ID#55426 is a project facility, and Record ID#55427 is an acquisition facility.4. In August 2004, XSchweiz was awarded the rights to explore and the option to develop Las Bambas through the privatisation process run by the government of Peru. The privatisation process was conducted through an international bid process run by ProInversion. XSchweiz was the successful bidder and was awarded certain rights in relation to the Las Bambas Project, including an option to develop the Las Bambas Project (the “Option”). XSchweiz subsequently appointed XPERU (as its local subsidiary) to be the holder of the Option on 1 October 2004 for a term of five years, with the ability to extend for an additional year. In 2007, XPERU assigned the Option to XTintaya and XTintaya exercised its Option right in August 2010 and entered into a transfer agreement, dated 2 September 2010, pursuant to which it acquired the Las Bambas Project for US$45.5 million plus US$0.5 million and US$0.75 million for each six-month period in year five and year six of the Option, respectively. XTintaya subsequently assigned the Las Bambas Project to the Minera Las Bambas S.A.C. on 1 January 2011.

The first 50 km of heavy haul road was put into service on September 15, 2012. The first permanent concrete poured (Flotation Area Tower Crane) was poured in August 2012. The project had achieved a 19% completion rate as of October 2012. MMG completed its acquisition of the Las Bambas mine in August 2014. Mine development began in August 2015 and commercial production began on July 1, 2016. The mine has resulted in multiple environmental conflicts between 2015 and 2022. About 15,000 people protested the mine during the early phases of construction, resulting in clashes with police who shot and killed four local people. There were continued protests in 2021-2022, when protestors blockaded the mine and complained that they received few benefits from the mine.",NA,Completion,Mixed,Debt rescheduling,0.25,OOF-like,600,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,NA,Top Create Resources Ltd,State-owned Company,No,NA,NA,MMG Limited (MMG),Chinese State-owned Company,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017-12-29,No,NA,2017-12-29,No,NA,NA,2017-12-29,No,NA,NA,NA,Fixed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,Not Applicable,Unallocable,4,4,https://minedocs.com/17/MMG_Quaterly_2017.pdf|https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/1222/2020122200985.pdf|https://announcements.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20171229/pdf/43qjbl1cwxsrr4.pdf|https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2014/0630/ltn20140630228.pdf,MMG Limited FOURTH QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017|MMG Limited Announcement Facility Agreement with ICBC|MMG Limited VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT FINANCIAL UPDATE|(1) VERY SUBSTANTIAL ACQUISITION IN RELATION TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE TARGET COMPANY HOLDING THE LAS BAMBAS PROJECT AND (2) CONTINUING CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS IN RELATION TO THE CMN FRAMEWORK OFFTAKE AGREEMENT,MMG Limited|MMG Limited|MMG Limited|MMG,Donor/Recipient Official Source|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Donor/Recipient Official Source|Implementing/Intermediary Organization Source,NA,NA,Yes,Upper middle income,"Las Bambas is a large, long-life copper development project located in the Apurimac region of Peru.

64763,NA,2101,2010 $745.5 million loan for the Letpadaung Copper Mine Project,China (People's Republic of),Myanmar,MMR,Asia,2010,2012,2016,Letpadaung Copper Mine,21,21,Copper,China Eximbank provides loan for the Letpadaung Copper Mine Project,"According to the the State Council Information Office of China, in 2010, China Eximbank provided a loan to support the implementation of the Letpadaung Copper Mine Project. The face value and borrowing terms are this loan are unknown.   The purpose of this $1.065 billion project was to construct a mine — with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of cathode copper per year — in Salingyi Township, Monywa City, and Sagaing Province. The project produced more than 60,000 tons of cathode copper in 2017 and generated more than $14 million in revenue for the Government of Myanmar.   The Letpadaung Copper Mine Project is a large mine project operated by Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Limited (MWMCL), a subsidiary of Wanbao Mining Limited that was created in September 2011. Wanbao Mining Limited, a subsidiary of China North Industries Group Corp. (Norinco), a large arms manufacturer, bought the project from Ivanhoe, a Canadian mining company in 2011. It did so in cooperation with the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL), which was granted a large scale production permit for the Letpadaung Copper Mine Project on March 5, 2010.  Ivanhoe had won the initial project from the Government of Myanmar pursuant to a series of agreements and feasibility studies from 1994 to 1996. A joint venture agreement was signed on April 10, 1996, but Ivanhoe divested its share of the project in 2011, citing the impact of the negative stigma of working with the military government on its other business throughout the world.   The project commenced under MWMCL ownership with Norinco International Cooperation Limited serving as the EPC contractor. Work began on November 20, 2011 and officially ended on March 11, 2016. On March 20, 2012, the foundation laying ceremony for the project was held.   The Letpadaung Copper Mine has faced substantial social risks stemming from its development. One major issue is the forced displacement of local villagers from their lands, which led to accusations of land confiscation and inadequate resettlement efforts. These actions disrupted lives and stripped many families of their primary means of livelihood, as farming is the main occupation in the area. This loss exacerbated poverty and further fueled resentment toward the project. Shortly after mine construction began in 2012, local villagers protested, raising concerns about environmental damage, land confiscation, involuntary resettlement, and various health risks associated with the mine. The authorities in Myanmar responded by brutally suppressing protesters, which in turn led to the creation of an investigative commission (led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi) and the eventual renegotiation of a production sharing contract between MWMCL, the Government of Myanmar, and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL) in 2013. The final, revised contract (signed on July 24, 2013) reduced the ownership stake of MWMCL from 45% to 30%, while the ownership stake of the Government of Myanmar increased from 4% to 51%. The renegotiated contract also required that 2% of net profits be earmarked for reinvestment in the local community (via corporate social responsibility projects). Such incidents highlighted the lack of meaningful community consultation and the failure to address the grievances of affected populations. Furthermore, the project has been criticized for its lack of transparency and governance, with agreements and financial dealings shrouded in opacity. This has eroded public trust and stoked fears of corruption and exploitation, compounding the social tensions surrounding the project.  The environmental risks associated with the Letpadaung Copper Mine are equally significant. In its early stages, the project faced criticism for inadequate environmental safeguards and a failure to conduct thorough Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) before operations began. This oversight raised concerns about the effectiveness of later mitigation measures. Mining activities in the area have disrupted local ecosystems, leading to soil degradation and water pollution that could have long-lasting effects on agriculture and public health. Additionally, the risk of chemical runoff from copper mining operations poses a severe threat to nearby water sources, potentially harming both the environment and the communities that rely on these resources. These environmental issues, coupled with poor regulatory oversight, have fueled widespread opposition and highlighted the urgent need for stricter environmental protections and better governance to ensure sustainable development.","1.

The loan had two tranches: a $425 million tranche (with a 10-year maturity) from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and an $875 million tranche (with a 7-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points) supported by Mizuho Bank, Export Development Canada, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), the Chile Branch of Bank of China, and the Grand Cayman Branch of Bank of China. The Los Pelambres copper mine in Coquimbo region of Chile is currently being expanded in two phases. The mine has been operating since 2000 and currently produces copper concentrates containing gold and silver and a separate molybdenum concentrate. The $1.8bn expansion project, approved in November 2018, is expected to add an average of 60,000t of copper a year to the mine’s production over the first 15 years of operation. Environment impact assessment (EIA) for the expansion project was approved in February 2018. Construction is expected to start in early-2019, while production from the first phase is anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Copper production from the second phase is anticipated to start in 2022. Minera Los Pelambres, a contractual mining company owned and managed by Antofagasta Minerals, is the project developer. Antofagasta holds 60% interest in the project through Antofagasta Minerals, while the remaining stake is held by a Japanese consortium comprising JX Nippon and Mitsubishi Materials, Marubeni, Mitsubishi Corp, and Mitsui & Co. Los Pelambres is located approximately 45km east from the city of Salamanca and 200km north of Santiago, Coquimbo, Chile. The two-phased expansion project will include the addition of a new semi-autogenous (SAG) mill, ball mill, and corresponding flotation circuit with 24 additional cells. The first phase, referred to as complementary infrastructure project (INCO), is focused on optimizing the production and eliminating the risks arising from the current operating and environmental permits. A new grinding line and a new flotation line will be installed at the existing Piuquenes plant to increase the ore processing capacity from 175,000 tpd to 190,000 tpd. The new additions are expected to increase the company’s fine copper production by 60,000 tpa from the second half of 2021. A reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant, with a processing capacity of up to 400 liters per second of industrial water, is also proposed to be constructed adjacent to the Punta Chungo port in Los Vilos. The desalinated water will be transported to the existing water recirculation facilities near the El Mauro tailings dam through a 61km-long buried pipeline. The first phase is estimated to involve a capital expenditure of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $600m is allocated for strengthening the milling and flotation. The remaining amount is allocated for the desalination plant and the water impulsion system. The second phase of expansion is expected to increase copper production from the mine by 35,000t a year. A new environmental impact assessment (EIA) will also be undertaken to increase the capacity of El Mauro tailings storage facility and create new mine waste dumps. Estimated to cost approximately $500m, the second phase will include additional mining equipment for increasing the crushing and grinding capacity, and flotation cells. Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia (FCAB) is providing rail and truck services at the copper mine, while Antofagasta Terminal Internacional (ATI) is responsible for the port operations. HighService Engineering and Construction (HSIC) is conducting industrial assembly work, mainly mechanics and structure, at the project. Bechtel built the original copper concentrator at the Los Pelambres mine, which was followed by installation of a $40m pebble crusher in 2001 and additional conveying, grinding, and flotation equipment. It also participated in the Repower II expansion project, which increased the concentrator's capacity by 20% from 132,000 to 159,000 metric tons a day. Bechtel subcontracted CiDRA Minerals Processing for the supply of SONARtrac® process monitoring systems to Minera Los Pelambres.","1.

It lies to the south of the main Luishi orebody. The Kipoi copper/cobalt exploration project of Tiger Resources lies to the southeast. The Luisha South Copper and Cobalt Mining Project includes a small historical open pit mine and waste rock pile, as well as the underlying Roan group sediments assumed to hold major deposits of copper and cobalt. The Luisha South ore was explored between 1923 and 1928 through shafts and tunnels, finding that there was about 350,000 tonnes of ore at 8.6% copper. Most of this was later mined in a small open pit. Since closure, artisanal miners have continued to work the site sporadically. The pit is in the northwest corner of the property at coordinates 11.178886°S 27.016658°E. On March 26, 2010, African Metals Corporation — a company incorporated on May 12, 1980, in British Columbia, Canada — acquired 100% of Chevalier Resources Inc, a company incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act, which held a 57% equity stake in Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL, a company incorporated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which held a 100% interest in the Luisha copper-cobalt property in DRC. In 2010, African Metals Corporation, through its subsidiary, Chevalier Resources Inc, acquired an additional 18% equity stake bringing its total equity stake in Luisha to 75%. On July 27, 2016, the DRC Government, in accordance with Article 71 of the DRC Mining Code (2002), granted a full Exploitation Permit license valid until April 3, 2046. As per the DRC Mining Code (2002), African Metals Corporation transferred 5% of its existing LME shares to the DRC Government, which interest cannot be diluted. African Metals Corporation incorporated Kundelungu Minerals Resources Sprl (KMR) in the DRC for the purpose of acquiring other mineral properties and related business activities in that country. African Metals Corporation also incorporated two BVI subsidiaries, African Metals Holdings (BVI) Ltd., which owned the 75% interest in LME in replacement of Chevalier Resources Inc, and African Metals Resources (BVI) Ltd. KMR was 99% owned by African Metals Corporation. On July 27, 2016, the application for the renewal and conversion of the Luisha South PEPM 4881 permit to a full 30-year mining exploitation permit (PE) was approved and granted. As a condition of the granting of the permit in accordance with the DRC Mining Code Article 71, African Metals Corporation approved the transfer to the DRC government of a 5% interest in the shares of Luisha Mining Enterprises, which held the exploitation permit for the Luisha South Copper and Cobalt Mining Project, as one of the final stages before the issuance of the PE 4881 permit certificates. The DRC Government share interest was to be free of charge and could not be diluted. Following the Article 71 share transfer, African Metals Corporation held a 71.25% interest in the Luisha South Copper and Cobalt Mining Project and TSM Entreprise S.A.R.L. (TSM) held the remaining 23.75% interest. All fees were paid for the PE 4881 permit and the permit was issued to Luisha Mining Enterprises. Then, on May 23, 2018, African Metals Corporation entered into a purchase agreement with Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL (LME), Excellen Minerals SARL (the “project company”) and Simeon Tshisangama, the President of TSM Entreprise S.A.R.L. (TSM). The agreement was subsequently amended and supplemented by the parties by a supplemental agreement dated August 9, 2018. Then, on December 6, 2018, the acquisition was finalized. In order to facilitate the acquisition, ICBC and China-Africa Fund for Industrial Cooperation Co., Ltd. (CAFIC or 中非产能合作基金有限责任公司) provided a loan to Hong Kong Excellen Mining Investment Co., Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shanghai Putailai New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.), which it apparently used to inject equity capital into the project company (Excellen Minerals SARL). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, African Metals Corporation agreed to sell its 71.25% equity stake in the Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL — and, by extension, the Luisha South Copper and Cobalt Mining Project — to Excellen Minerals SARL for $10 million. Prior to the acquisition, African Metals Corporation indirectly owned 71.25% of Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL, TSM owned 23.75% of Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo owned 5% of Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL. Ownership of Luisha Mining Enterprise SARL conferred control over (i) mining rights in the Luisha South copper and cobalt mining area governed by No. 4881 mining license in the DRC; (ii) ore mined from the Luisha South copper and cobalt mining area; (iii) other movables and real estates; and (iv) a dense medium separation (DMS) plant.","1. This project is also known as the Comilu Project or the Luishia Copper and Cobalt Mining Project. The project title is 刚果民主共和国绿纱铜钴矿项目 or 刚果（金）绿纱 3 万吨铜/年湿法冶炼项目. 2. The Luisha South Copper and Cobalt Mine should not be confused with the Luisha Copper and Cobalt Mine. On April 7, 2006, a joint venture called Compagnie Minière de Luisha (COMILU or 绿纱矿业有限责任公司 or 绿纱矿业) was established by China Overseas Engineering Corporation (COVEC) and Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) to mine 26.1 million tons of copper and cobalt deposits at the Luisha deposit (locational coordinates: -11.16889, 27.00917). At that time, COVEC held a 72% equity stake and Gécamines held a 28% equity stake in COMILU. 3. In 2019, the Chinese Government centralized the management of China-Latin America and Caribbean Industrial Investment and Cooperation Fund (CLAIFund) and China-Africa Fund for Industrial Cooperation Co., Ltd. (CAFIC), such that the two state-owned funds’ project appraisal and investment decisions were unified under the management of a single new company under SAFE, while continuing to operate under separate names. 80% of CAFIC is owned by SAFE’s wholly-owned arm Wutongshu Investment Platform. China Eximbank owns the remaining 20%. See https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-02-19/exclusive-china-to-combine-africa-latin-america-investment-funds-101381418.html. 4.

The key elements of the Corporate Facility are a 3-year US$220 million term loan with quarterly principal and an interest rate of 4% and a 5-year (with an optional one-year extension) US$180 million revolving facility with an interest rate of 4.75% for the first two years then 4% for the remaining time in which the Company is allowed full repayment and/or full redraw of, up to the facility limit, over the term. The sponsor has the option to extend the term loan and revolver by $80 million and $100 million respectively. The deal smoothed the principal debt repayments more evenly over the life of the loans without changing the tenor of the various facilities. However, Equinox had to pay an additional 50bp margin from 1 April 2009 on the outstanding senior debt facilities. The refi sees the Lumwana Mining Company's (LMC) parent company, Equinox Minerals, and its subsidiary, refinance US$400 million in senior and subordinated project finance debt. Equinox and LMC can also request an increase of up to $200m in the amount available, subject to the consent of the banks. The Corporate Facility will be used to repay certain existing senior and subordinated project loan facilities provided to the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Lumwana Mining Company (""LMC"") in 2006 for the $814 million Lumwana copper project in Zambia. The parties said the terms ""represent a much more traditional refinancing structure, as against other more novel structures that have been used recently to refinance debt, and is an indication of liquidity returning to the banking market."" Equinox and LMC were advised by Norton Rose in the deal, while Clifford Chance advised the lender group.","1. Aiddata calculated the interest rates of this loan using base points. The $220 million three-year term loan was priced at 400bp (meaning 4% interest rate) and a $180 million five-year revolver at 475bp for the first two years, which then drops to 400bp (meaning 4.75% and 4%). 2.

The loan consists of two tranches (facilities): a $520 million, 12-year senior secured amortizing project debt facility and a $51.6 million, 10-year senior secured closure bonding facility. Finnish export credit agency Finnvera has given a raw material guarantee for the project, that covers $250 million of the senior debt. The guarantee is linked to a 10-year offtake agreement for 75,000 tons per annum (tpa) of copper concentrate with Boliden Commercial. The purpose of the project is to expand the Mantoverde copper mine in Chile. The Mantoverde mine is a 2,770-hectare open pit oxide operation located in the Atacama Region in Northern Chile. The mine has been operating since 1995 and it includes a solvent extraction electrowinning processing plant designed to produce up to 60,000 tons of copper cathode per annum (“tpa”). The existing operation currently produces approximately 45,000 tpa of cathodes, which are transported by truck to the ports of Angamos and Antofagasta. The Mantoverde Copper Mine Development Project involves the open pit extraction of sulphide ore, which lies below the existing oxide pits. Sulphide reserves from these deposits will be processed through a new concentrator plant to produce copper concentrates containing gold as by-product. The concentrates will be thickened, filtered, and ultimately transported by truck to a port in the region. The project will consist of the expansion of existing (i) oxide pits, (ii) tailing storage facility, (iii) desalination plant, and (iv) ancillary works related to expansion; as well as the construction of a new concentrator plant. This is a large scale project, with material impact in job creation, contribution to Chile’s GDP and will help contribute to bridging the global copper supply gap once operational. Ausenco Chile Ltda. is the contractor responsible for project implementation.","1. The size of Bank of China’s contribution to the syndicate is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes equal contributions ($38,106,666) by the 15 known members of the syndicate. 2. The breakdown of the contributions that lenders made to the two facilities (tranches) is unknown.

(51% ownership stake) and China's Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A. (49% ownership stake) — was legally incorporated in Peru and given responsibility for the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. Then, on November 28, 2012, Shougang Hierro Perú S.A.A. — special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese steel group Shougang Co. — signed a $240 million syndicated loan agreement with Banco de Crédito, Citibank, HSBC and Santander for the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. The loan carried an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.38% margin. The proceeds of the loan were to be used to partially finance the $600 million cost of the the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. The remaining $360 million was financed through a syndicated loan from China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank and equity contributions. CDB and China Eximbank’s contributions are captured via Record ID#102971 and Record ID#102972, respectively. The purpose of the project was to expand Marcona mine, which is a large iron, copper, and zinc mine located in western Peru in Marcona District and Nazca Province (exact coordinates: -15.2039, -75.1085). The scope of the project also involved expanding its primary and secondary processing facilities and installing a conveyor transportation system. After obtaining a construction permit in December 2013, the project commenced in August 2014 and reached completion in December 2016. Then, in June 2017, ICBC Perú Bank S.A. and Shougang Hierro Perú S.A.A. signed a $500 million loan agreement for the Second Stage of Marcona Mine Expansion Project (captured via Record ID#102970). The loan carried the follow borrowing terms: a 10.25-year maturity (final maturity date: September 2027), a 2-year grace period, and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to refinance and its debts and to support the second stage of the expansion of the Marcona Mine. The borrower made a $100 million prepayment in 2020, which further reduced the final maturity date to 2025. Then, the borrower made a $150 million prepayment in 2021, which further reduced the final maturity date to 2023. The Second Stage of Marcona Mine Expansion Project involved the construction of a seawater desalinization plant to process tailings and the expansion of a beneficiation plant. Construction began in June 2016 and the project was completed on July 31, 2018.","1. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3% to average 3-month LIBOR in June 2017 (1.26241%). 2. The Shougang Hierro Mine in Peru has been marred by controversy since its inception, which predates Chinese ownership in 1992. The mine first began operating in February 1952, when the Republic of Peru signed a concession contract with the U.S.-based Marcona Mining Company. For the next 20 years or so, Marcona was able to successfully export Peru’s iron to countries like Japan and the U.S. In the early 1970s, the mine began to struggle economically, but after leftists successfully carried out a coup and took power of the country in 1975, the mine was nationalized by the new government. The mine was renamed Hierro Peru, or Iron Peru. During this period, the mine also struggled financially. By the 1990s, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce, the mine was ‘on the verge of bankruptcy.’ In 1992, former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori decided to privatize Hierro Peru. Chinese state-owned Shougang Group won the bid, renamed the mine to Shougang Hierro Peru, and subsequently became China’s first major investment project in Latin America. Shougang has been operating the iron mine ever since. Initially, Shougang was successful in helping turn around the struggling mine. According to research by Xin Gou, the Chinese company was able to turn a $32 million loss in 1992 into a $5 million profit in 1993. However, since nearly day one of Chinese operation, there have been disputes with locals. In the decades since taking over the mine, protests surrounding issues like salary and safety regulations have been commonplace. 3.

(51% ownership stake) and China's Shougang Hierro Peru S.A.A. (49% ownership stake) — was legally incorporated in Peru and given responsibility for the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. Then, on November 28, 2012, Shougang Hierro Perú S.A.A. — special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese steel group Shougang Co. — signed a $240 million syndicated loan agreement with Banco de Crédito, Citibank, HSBC and Santander for the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. The loan carried an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.38% margin. The proceeds of the loan were to be used to partially finance the $600 million cost of the the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project. The remaining $360 million was financed through a syndicated loan from China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank and equity contributions. CDB and China Eximbank’s contributions are captured via Record ID#102971 and Record ID#102972, respectively. The purpose of the project was to expand Marcona mine, which is a large iron, copper, and zinc mine located in western Peru in Marcona District and Nazca Province (exact coordinates: -15.2039, -75.1085). The scope of the project also involved expanding its primary and secondary processing facilities and installing a conveyor transportation system. After obtaining a construction permit in December 2013, the project commenced in August 2014 and reached completion in December 2016. Then, in June 2017, ICBC Perú Bank S.A. and Shougang Hierro Perú S.A.A. signed a $500 million loan agreement for the Second Stage of Marcona Mine Expansion Project (captured via Record ID#102970). The loan carried the follow borrowing terms: a 10.25-year maturity (final maturity date: September 2027), a 2-year grace period, and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to refinance and its debts and to support the second stage of the expansion of the Marcona Mine. The borrower made a $100 million prepayment in 2020, which further reduced the final maturity date to 2025. Then, the borrower made a $150 million prepayment in 2021, which further reduced the final maturity date to 2023. The Second Stage of Marcona Mine Expansion Project involved the construction of a seawater desalinization plant to process tailings and the expansion of a beneficiation plant. Construction began in June 2016 and the project was completed on July 31, 2018.","1. The precise date of the loan commitment from CDB and China Eximbank is unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the commitment date (November 28, 2012) of the other syndicated loan from Banco de Crédito, Citibank, Santander and HSBC that supported the First Stage of the Marcona Iron Mine Expansion Project. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. The precise face value of the syndicated loan from China Eximbank and CDB is unknown. However, it is known that the total cost of the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project was $600 million and that Minera Shouxin S.A. covered the cost of the First Stage of the Marcona Mine Expansion Project with a combination of debt and equity financing. For the time being, AidData assumes a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30, which implies a syndicated loan commitment of $180 million from CDB/China Eximbank (after accounting for the $240 million syndicated loan from Banco de Crédito, Citibank, Santander and HSBC). AidData assumes equal contributions ($90,000,000) from CDB and China Eximbank for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. It appears that the borrower of record is Shougang Hierro Perú S.A.A. rather than Minera Shouxin S.A. This issue warrants further investigation. 4. An additional phase of the project commenced in February 2021 and there is some circumstantial evidence (see https://chambers.com/department/rubio-leguia-normand-banking-finance-latin-america-9:6:171:1:2448) that CDB may have financed the additional phase. This issue warrants further investigation. 5. The Shougang Hierro Mine in Peru has been marred by controversy since its inception, which predates Chinese ownership in 1992. The mine first began operating in February 1952, when the Republic of Peru signed a concession contract with the U.S.-based Marcona Mining Company. For the next 20 years or so, Marcona was able to successfully export Peru’s iron to countries like Japan and the U.S. In the early 1970s, the mine began to struggle economically, but after leftists successfully carried out a coup and took power of the country in 1975, the mine was nationalized by the new government. The mine was renamed Hierro Peru, or Iron Peru. During this period, the mine also struggled financially. By the 1990s, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce, the mine was ‘on the verge of bankruptcy.’ In 1992, former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori decided to privatize Hierro Peru. Chinese state-owned Shougang Group won the bid, renamed the mine to Shougang Hierro Peru, and subsequently became China’s first major investment project in Latin America. Shougang has been operating the iron mine ever since. Initially, Shougang was successful in helping turn around the struggling mine. According to research by Xin Gou, the Chinese company was able to turn a $32 million loss in 1992 into a $5 million profit in 1993. However, since nearly day one of Chinese operation, there have been disputes with locals. In the decades since taking over the mine, protests surrounding issues like salary and safety regulations have been commonplace. 6.

64616,2346|3109,2802,2014 syndicated loan to CRCC for Mirador Copper Mine Project,China (People's Republic of),Ecuador,ECU,America,2014,2015,2019,Mirador Copper Mine,28,28,Copper,"China Development Bank contributes to $1.29 billion syndicated loan to CRCC for Mirador Copper Mine Project (Linked to Record ID#64615, #100810 and #100811)","In 2014, a Chinese bank syndicate (consisting of China Development Bank, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China) provided a $1.29 billion loan to Ecuacorriente S.A.（厄瓜多尔科里安特公司 or ECSA) -- a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) and Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group -- for the Mirador Copper Mine Project. The loan carries a 10 year maturity and an unknown interest rate.   The purpose of the project was to develop Mirador copper mine, which is located along the valley of the Rio Zamora in Zamora-Chinchipe Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 03°34'N latitude and 78°26'W.   China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) No.2 Engineering Company was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on December 21, 2015. The project was partially suspended over environmental concerns in March 2018, but the mine was ultimately completed and put into operation on July 18, 2019. Then, in January 2020, Ecuacorriente S.A. exported its first ever shipment of 22,000 tons of copper concentrate from the Mirador mine. It was shipped to the Chinese city of Tongling, one of China’s most important copper production bases and TNMG’s place of origin, to supply TNMG’s smelting production.  In 2020, Ecuador's General Comptroller conducted a special examination of the project, which concluded that irregularities occurred between July 2013 and September 2019. The General Comptroller report claims that, between 2009 and 2016, the mining activities of Ecuacorriente S.A. affected the Wawayme, Tundayme, and Quimi rivers by exposing them to metals and minerals. During the same period, Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment requested a new study from Ecuacorriente S.A., which was delivered in October 2018 and confirmed the high concentrations of metals in the three rivers.   The General Comptroller also detected a lack of control by the Ministry of the Environment, since between 2016 and 2019 the Ministry did not require the company to take ‘corrective actions’, thus putting local communities that use the river at risk. Also, the General  Comptroller’s report determined that the environmental monitoring and audits carried out between 2015 and 2017 by Ecuacorriente S.A. regarding the exploitation and benefit phases of the project were conducted without authorization from the Ministry of the Environment. This lack of oversight meant that, until the closing of the special examination in September 2019, the environmental performance of the Mirador project was unknown and measures aimed at environmental repair, restoration, and remediation were not applied.

The loan carries a 10 year maturity and an unknown interest rate.  The purpose of the project was to develop Mirador copper mine, which is located along the valley of the Rio Zamora in Zamora-Chinchipe Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 03°34'N latitude and 78°26'W.  China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) No.2 Engineering Company was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on December 21, 2015. The project was partially suspended over environmental concerns in March 2018, but the mine was ultimately completed and put into operation on July 18, 2019. Then, in January 2020, Ecuacorriente S.A. exported its first ever shipment of 22,000 tons of copper concentrate from the Mirador mine. It was shipped to the Chinese city of Tongling, one of China’s most important copper production bases and TNMG’s place of origin, to supply TNMG’s smelting production.  In 2020, Ecuador's General Comptroller conducted a special examination of the project, which concluded that irregularities occurred between July 2013 and September 2019. The General Comptroller report claims that, between 2009 and 2016, the mining activities of Ecuacorriente S.A. affected the Wawayme, Tundayme, and Quimi rivers by exposing them to metals and minerals. During the same period, Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment requested a new study from Ecuacorriente S.A., which was delivered in October 2018 and confirmed the high concentrations of metals in the three rivers.  The General Comptroller also detected a lack of control by the Ministry of the Environment, since between 2016 and 2019 the Ministry did not require the company to take ‘corrective actions’, thus putting local communities that use the river at risk. Also, the General Comptroller’s report determined that the environmental monitoring and audits carried out between 2015 and 2017 by Ecuacorriente S.A. regarding the exploitation and benefit phases of the project were conducted without authorization from the Ministry of the Environment. This lack of oversight meant that, until the closing of the special examination in September 2019, the environmental performance of the Mirador project was unknown and measures aimed at environmental repair, restoration, and remediation were not applied.

HBIS subsequently secured a $267.2 million China Development Bank loan (with a 7-year maturity) to facilitate the acquisition. The acquisition was completed in August 2013. Upon the completion of the transaction, HBIS operated and managed Palabora Mining Company Limited (PMC) as its largest shareholder. While HBIS acquired 35% of the shares with the help of the loan from CDB, the other 39.5% is likely to come from private resources (see Record ID#30493).   PMC (founded August 1956) is a publicly traded mining company headquartered in Phalaborwa, Limpopo province, South Africa. The company operates a single cluster of open-pit and underground mines producing mainly copper as well as byproducts such as precious metals from anode slimes, nickel sulfate, sulfuric acid, magnetite, and vermiculite. Palabora also has processing facilities on site for the production of purified copper from mined copper ore, and a vermiculite recovery plant. Its final copper product has two forms namely, copper cathode and copper rod. PMC's open cast mine is Africa's widest man-made hole at almost 2,000 m (6,600 ft) wide.","1.

Then, on August 10, 2007, syndication of the loan to six further banks, including China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), was completed. The $242 million USD loan consisted of a $160 million USD construction facility an interest rate based on a floating rate plus a margin of 250 basis points (bps) and a $25 million USD cost overrun facility with an interest rate based on a floating rate plus a margin of 325 bps, a $20 million USD working capital facility with an interest rate based on a floating rate plus a margin of 200 bps, and a $2 million USD letter of credit facility with an interest rate based on a floating rate plus a margin of 200 bps.

The debt was covered by private political risk insurers. CCB contributed $18.75 million USD. In addition to CCB, the following lenders contributed the respective amounts: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) ($37 million USD), BCEL ($10 million), National Australia Bank ($25 million USD), DZ Bank ($25 million USD), Standard Chartered ($25 million USD), Fortis ($18.75 million USD), KBC ($26.25 million USD), KfW ($11.25 million USD), and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) ($10 million) USD. In March 2007, ANZ launched the early bird syndication for PanAust Limited's Phu Kham Copper-Gold Project. The early banks in the facility were BCEL (a government-owned Lao bank), DZ Bank, nabCapital, and Standard Chartered, which were also allocated a pro-rata apportionment of the hedging.

64223,NA,3002,2013 syndicated loan to support PanAust's business activities in Laos,China (People's Republic of),Lao People's Democratic Republic,LAO,Asia,2013,NA,NA,Phu Kham Copper-Gold Mine,30,30,Copper,ICBC contributes to $250 million syndicated loan to support PanAust's business activities in Laos,"On January 23, 2013, ICBC entered into a syndicate of seven banks led by ANZ bank to provide $250 million in total for PanAust Limited for the company's working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures on growth projects (including Phu Bia copper and gold financing operations) in Laos, and general corporate purposes (or 泛澳大利亚资源公司旗下老挝铜金矿项目). The exact amount of financing that ICBC provided towards this syndicated loan, though, is unclear. The revolving debt facility syndicate comprises ANZ (mandated lead arranger and book runner), Barclays, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ICBC, Investec, Natixis and Sumitomo Mitsui. Drawdown on the facilities is subject to conditions precedent usual for facilities of this type.   The loan has a maturity of 4 years and interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% (plus political risk insurance). In January 2013, the average 6-month LIBOR rate was 0.488%, which when added to the base of 3.5% totals an interest rate for this loan as 3.988%.   This facility replaced a $100 million facility, which was signed in 2010 and scheduled to mature in September 2013. The facility is meant to, in part, contribute to the growth of PanAust's enterprises in Laos, including the Ban Houayxai Gold-Silver Operation and the Phu Kham Copper-Gold Operation. These mines are operated by Phu Bia Mining, a Lao-registered company 90% owned by PanAust and 10% owned by the Lao government. The Ban Houayxai (BHX) gold (Au) – Silver (Ag) deposit is located approximately 100km north of Vientiane at 18°55’N latitude and 102°40’E longitude. The Phu Kham copper-gold deposit is located in the Xaisomboun District in Vientiane Province in Lao PDR, approximately 100 km northeast of the capital city of Vientiane.   The environmental risks of the Phu Kam mine include significant challenges posed by poorly managed development activities, including habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and water contamination from pollutants such as heavy metals and chemicals. Air pollution from industrial emissions and improper waste disposal further exacerbate ecological and public health threats, contributing to long-term land and water degradation. There have also been some reports of potential river pollution during the rainy season. These risks underscore the critical need for thorough environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to identify, mitigate, and monitor potential impacts, ensuring sustainable and responsible project management.","1.

64520,783,3201,2008 loan for Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project,China (People's Republic of),Papua New Guinea,PNG,Oceania,2008,2006,2012,Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project,32,32,Nickel|Cobalt,China Eximbank provides $560 million loan for Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project (Linked to Record ID#64653),"In 2004, China Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. signed a development framework agreement with the Papua New Guinea government and foreign partner companies, Highlands Pacific Company Co Ltd and PNG stakeholders Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), for the development of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. In 2005, China Metallurgical Group and its partners signed a 'Master Agreement' and an 'Association Agreement' to establish a framework for financing the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project.   Then, on July 23, 2008, MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of MCC-JJJ Mining Development Co. — finalized a $1.4 billion financing package necessary to complete the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Mine Project. The project was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. 40% of the total project cost was financed through a China Eximbank loan worth $560 million (captured via Record ID#64520) and 30% of the total project cost was financed through a 10-year, $473 million syndicated shareholder loan from MCC-JJJ Mining Development Company Ltd. The loans were to be repaid by 2017 (8 years from the commissioning date of the mine). The interest rate of the USD-denominated loan was set to LIBOR (3.119%) plus a 1.6% margin and the interest rate of the RMB-denominated loan was approximately 4.7%. The remaining project costs were financed via shareholder equity contributions.   The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The project comprises the Kurumbukari (“KBK”) mine and a beneficiation plant (designed to treat around 4.6 million tons of ore per annum), located on the Kurumbukari plateau, in the foothills of the Bismarck Ranges, 600-800 meters above sea level and 75 kilometers (“km”) to the southwest of the provincial capital of Madang, and the Basamuk processing plant located on the coast, approximately 55 km southeast of Madang. The KBK mine is at latitude 5° 34´ S and longitude 145° 13´ E and the Basamuk refinery is at latitude 5° 32´ S and longitude 145° 8´E. Beneficiated ore is pumped from the mine as a slurry to the plant via a 135km pipeline. The Basamuk plant is designed to produce a mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide product containing around 32,600 tonnes nickel and 3,300 tonnes cobalt on an annual basis.   China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On November 3, 2006, a foundation laying ceremony took place. However, the implementation of the project was delayed for two years due to legal appeals over environmental issues. Also, in January 2008, local landowners staged a protest against the project Managers from China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd and four local chiefs held crisis talks in Madang town over a range of grievances. The landowners demanded that China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd stop operations until the dispute was settled. The landowners presented 18 points, complaining about their lack of participation in spin-off business, the employment of heavily armed Chinese security guards, discrimination at the work site and language barriers.   One month earlier, a former PNG health minister, Sir Peter Barter, called for an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project after discrediting the existing EIA. PNG's Lutheran head bishop, Doctor Wesley Kigasung, also warned that pollution from the mine could cause up to 80,000 sea-dependent locals to lose their livelihoods. The project was ultimately completed and handed over on December 6, 2012.  In 2014, local rioting broke out against Chinese workers at the KBK mine.   Then, in February 2020, a coalition of more than 5,000 villagers and a provincial government in Papua New Guinea sued MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd., demanding not only that its Chinese owners pay restitution totaling 18 billion kina ($5.2 billion), but also that it stop dumping mine waste into the ocean and remediate the allegedly contaminated waters. Half a million people rely on the local fisheries in the Coral Triangle biodiversity hot spot, and the plaintiffs argue that their lives and food supply are at stake. The lawsuit appears to seek the highest environmental damages in the country’s history, and it relies on some of the biggest studies on the ocean dumping of mine waste ever conducted. The tipping point for the lawsuit was an August 2019 slurry spill that caught the eye of the international press as photos of crimson-red ocean waters circulated. Dead fish and a poisoned baby dolphin washed up on shore, and a man died from a “cocktail of heavy metals,” the lawsuit alleges. Madang Governor Peter Yama, who has opposed the Ramu project for years, reportedly called the spill “the worst environmental disaster in Papua New Guinea history.""  The CEPA administers the Environment Act, the primary legislative instrument governing all aspects of the environment in relation to resource development activities. The Ramu project is operated under the Environment Act 2000. The Kurumbukari mine and beneficiation plant and the Basamuk processing plant are operated by MCC Ramu under Environment Permits WD-L3(115) and WE-L3(85) issued by the Independent State of Papua New Guinea under Section 65 of the Environment Act 2000. The key Environmental Approval for the project is the Environmental Plan Approval issued under the Environmental Planning Act 1978 in March 2000 by the Minister for Environment and Conservation and Operational Environmental Monitoring Plan (“OEMP”). The operations permits are WD-L3(115) which covers all works within SML 8, all LMPs, MEs and ML 149. Permit WE-L3(85) covers the extraction and use of water resources within SML 8, all LMPs, MEs and ML 149. Both of these permits were issued on 1 January 2004 for a term of 50 years, and various amendments have been made to the initial permits issued. Permit WD-L3(115) also approves the discharge of waste streams into the environment from the various premises, including air emissions and tailings discharge via the Deep Sea Tailings Pipeline (DSTP). Both the mine and processing plant are operated under various environment protection management sub-plans which are consolidated in the Environmental Management Plan, including air emissions, noise, water, chemical spill and control, dust control, erosion and sediment control, water resources, and progressive rehabilitation. Other socio-economic management plans include cultural, historical and archaeological heritage, and social and economic management.","1.

Ltd. signed a development framework agreement with the Papua New Guinea government and foreign partner companies, Highlands Pacific Company Co Ltd and PNG stakeholders Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), for the development of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. In 2005, China Metallurgical Group and its partners signed a 'Master Agreement' and an 'Association Agreement' to establish a framework for financing the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. Then, on July 23, 2008, MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of MCC-JJJ Mining Development Co. — finalized a $1.4 billion financing package necessary to complete the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Mine Project. The project was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. 40% of the total project cost was financed through a China Eximbank loan worth $560 million (captured in Record ID#64520) and 30% of the total project cost was financed through a 10-year, $473 million syndicated shareholder loan from MCC-JJJ Mining Development Company Ltd. The loans were to be repaid by 2017 (8 years from the commissioning date of the mine). The interest rate of the USD-denominated loan was set to LIBOR (3.119%) plus a 1.6% margin and the interest rate of the RMB-denominated loan was approximately 4.7%. The remaining project costs were financed via shareholder equity contributions. The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The project comprises the Kurumbukari (“KBK”) mine and a beneficiation plant (designed to treat around 4.6 million tons of ore per annum), located on the Kurumbukari plateau, in the foothills of the Bismarck Ranges, 600-800 meters above sea level and 75 kilometers (“km”) to the southwest of the provincial capital of Madang, and the Basamuk processing plant located on the coast, approximately 55 km southeast of Madang. The KBK mine is at latitude 5° 34´ S and longitude 145° 13´ E and the Basamuk refinery is at latitude 5° 32´ S and longitude 145° 8´E. Beneficiated ore is pumped from the mine as a slurry to the plant via a 135km pipeline. The Basamuk plant is designed to produce a mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide product containing around 32,600 tonnes nickel and 3,300 tonnes cobalt on an annual basis. China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On November 3, 2006, a foundation laying ceremony took place. However, the implementation of the project was delayed for two years due to legal appeals over environmental issues. Also, in January 2008, local landowners staged a protest against the project Managers from China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd and four local chiefs held crisis talks in Madang town over a range of grievances. The landowners demanded that China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd stop operations until the dispute was settled. The landowners presented 18 points, complaining about their lack of participation in spin-off business, the employment of heavily armed Chinese security guards, discrimination at the work site and language barriers. One month earlier, a former PNG health minister, Sir Peter Barter, called for an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project after discrediting the existing EIA. PNG's Lutheran head bishop, Doctor Wesley Kigasung, also warned that pollution from the mine could cause up to 80,000 sea-dependent locals to lose their livelihoods. The project was ultimately completed and handed over on December 6, 2012. In 2014, local rioting broke out against Chinese workers at the KBK mine. Then, in February 2020, a coalition of more than 5,000 villagers and a provincial government in Papua New Guinea sued MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd., demanding not only that its Chinese owners pay restitution totaling 18 billion kina ($5.2 billion), but also that it stop dumping mine waste into the ocean and remediate the allegedly contaminated waters. Half a million people rely on the local fisheries in the Coral Triangle biodiversity hot spot, and the plaintiffs argue that their lives and food supply are at stake. The lawsuit appears to seek the highest environmental damages in the country’s history, and it relies on some of the biggest studies on the ocean dumping of mine waste ever conducted. The tipping point for the lawsuit was an August 2019 slurry spill that caught the eye of the international press as photos of crimson-red ocean waters circulated. Dead fish and a poisoned baby dolphin washed up on shore, and a man died from a “cocktail of heavy metals,” the lawsuit alleges. Madang Governor Peter Yama, who has opposed the Ramu project for years, reportedly called the spill “the worst environmental disaster in Papua New Guinea history.”","1.

ICBC and China Eximbank subsequently signed an accounts receivables financing facility agreement with CNMC for the Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project. CNMC, in turn, used the proceeds from the facility to on-lend to Metalkol SA (most likely through a deferred payment agreement) for the Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan to Metalkol SA are unknown. However, it is known that the loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It is also known that the borrower and project owner — Metalkol SA — pledged all of its assets and some assets of its affiliated companies as sources of collateral.  The Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project is located 26 km west from Kolwezi. It is the comprehensive hydro-metallurgical facility with the target capacity of 70 thousand tonnes of copper per annum (ktpa) and 14 ktpa of cobalt (Phase I) which will then be expanded to 105 ktpa of copper and 21 ktpa of cobalt (Phase II). CNMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction started in February 2017. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 24 months. It reached full phase 1 production in 2020.  Record ID#98642 captures the estimated financial commitment of China Eximbank to the financing facility, while Record ID#100786 captures the estimated financial commitment of ICBC.","1. The Chinese project title is RTR项目.   2. China Eximbank and ICBC likely signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with CNMC to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from an insurer and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, the insurer pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement.   3. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.   4. Several sources refers to the monetary value of the accounts receivable financing facility as $700 million. For the time being, AidData assumes that 85% of the cost of the $654,233,791 EPC contract was financed through the accounts receivables financing facility agreement. This issue warrants further investigation.   5. The individual contributions of ICBC and China Eximbank to the syndicated loan are unknown. Assuming that 85% of the cost of the $654,233,791 EPC contract was financed through the accounts receivables financing facility agreement, for the time being, AidData assumes equal contributions ($278,049,361.17) across all 2 known members of the syndicate.  6. The precise dates on which the accounts receivables financing facility agreement and the deferred payment/on-lending agreement were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the project implementation start date (February 2017) as a proxy for the official commitment date.

ICBC and China Eximbank subsequently signed an accounts receivables financing facility agreement with CNMC for the Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project. CNMC, in turn, used the proceeds from the facility to on-lend to Metalkol SA (most likely through a deferred payment agreement) for the Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan to Metalkol SA are unknown. However, it is known that the loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It is also known that the borrower and project owner — Metalkol SA — pledged all of its assets and some assets of its affiliated companies as sources of collateral.  The Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project is located 26 km west from Kolwezi. It is the comprehensive hydro-metallurgical facility with the target capacity of 70 thousand tonnes of copper per annum (ktpa) and 14 ktpa of cobalt (Phase I) which will then be expanded to 105 ktpa of copper and 21 ktpa of cobalt (Phase II). CNMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction started in February 2017. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 24 months. It reached full phase 1 production in 2020.  Record ID#98642 captures the estimated financial commitment of China Eximbank to the financing facility, while Record ID#100786 captures the estimated financial commitment of ICBC.","1. The Chinese project title is RTR项目.  2. China Eximbank and ICBC likely signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with CNMC to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from an insurer and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, the insurer pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement.  3. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.  4. Several sources refers to the monetary value of the accounts receivable financing facility as $700 million. For the time being, AidData assumes that 85% of the cost of the $654,233,791 EPC contract was financed through the accounts receivables financing facility agreement. This issue warrants further investigation.  5. The individual contributions of ICBC and China Eximbank to the syndicated loan are unknown. Assuming that 85% of the cost of the $654,233,791 EPC contract was financed through the accounts receivables financing facility agreement, for the time being, AidData assumes equal contributions ($278,049,361.17) across all 2 known members of the syndicate.6. The precise dates on which the accounts receivables financing facility agreement and the deferred payment/on-lending agreement were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the project implementation start date (February 2017) as a proxy for the official commitment date.

102999,620,3403,2013 $2.61 billion loan to increase the production capacity of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi,China (People's Republic of),Democratic Republic of the Congo,COD,Africa,2013,NA,NA,Sicomines Copper and Cobalt Mining Project,34,34,Copper|Cobalt,"[Sino-Congolese Programme] China Eximbank provides $2.61 billion loan to increase the production capacity of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi (Linked to Record ID#73145, #73204, #91873, #100887, #100888, #450, and #91875)","On September 17, 2007, a consortium consisting of China Eximbank, China Railways Construction Company (CREC), and Sinohydro and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a “protocol d’accord” (or “项目换资源协议”). According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68% equity stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32%. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement also specified the ownership structure of the Sicomines joint venture: CREC would hold a 43% equity stake in the joint venture, while Sinohydro would hold a 25% equity stake, Gécamines would hold a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) would hold a 12% equity stake. On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, such that CREC was given a 28% equity stake, Sinohydro was given a 20% equity stake, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was given a 20% equity stake, Gécamines was given a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika was given a 12% equity stake. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, with CREC holding a 33% equity stake, Sinohydro holding a 30% equity stake, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt holding a 5% equity stake, Gécamines holding a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika holding a 12% equity stake. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” the consortium of Chinese companies reportedly agreed to provide $2.982 billion via (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) a $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; (3) a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi; and (4) and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. Ultimately, however, it provided financial commitments worth $3.28 billion through (1) a $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to Sicomines SARL; (2) a $2.13 billion (buyer's credit) loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) to Sicomines SARL; (3) a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines; and (4) a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Record ID#73204, Record ID#100887, and Record ID#100888 capture the respective contributions of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to the $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan. Record ID#73145 captures the $2.13 billion loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91873. The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91875. The Congolese government initially agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms. However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced the size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and reportedly removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank, while leaving the sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi. China Eximbank and Sicomines SARL signed an additional loan agreement [contract identification number: 1410101062013211511] worth $2,610,000,000 in 2013 to increase production capacity at the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi. The loan carried an interest rate of 12-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin (rather than 6-month LIBOR plus a 1% margin). However, its other borrowing terms (maturity, grace period, fees) are unknown. On April 8, 2017, shortly before Congolese President Joseph Kabila left power, a fourth amendment to the “convention de collaboration” was signed (Avenant No. 4 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo). It was reportedly negotiated in secret and without the knowledge of the Congolese Ministry of Mines. It exempted Sicomines SARL from paying customs and taxes and effectively allowed for the payment of dividends to the shareholders of Sicomines SARL before loan repayments were made to its external creditors. Then, in 2020, Sicomines SARL signed a pre-financing agreement (also known as pre-export finance facility, PXF, and commodity prepayment facilty agreements) worth $1,771,048,731.89 with its Chinese state-owned shareholders (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co., Ltd). The loan carries an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.7% margin. Its other borrowing terms (maturity, grace period, fees) upon which Sicomines SARL borrowed are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was responsible for securing and repaying these debts (including principal and interest) via mineral export receipts. It is also known that the borrower failed to make scheduled principal and interest repayments worth $16,876,728.33 during calendar year 2021 and the loan's principal amount outstanding was $816,260,535.91 as of December 31, 2020 and $833,137,264.24 as of December 31, 2021. In December 2021, the DRC’s EITI multi-stakeholder group (ITIE-RDC) published an evaluation of the Sicomines agreement. It concluded that the agreement presented ""an unprecedented harm in the history of the DRC."" It claimed that a biased feasibility study was used as a basis for the investment decision, copper reserves were undervalued, many infrastructure projects remained incomplete, and the fourth amendment to the “convention de collaboration” diverted profits to shareholders rather repaying lenders on a first-priority basis. Months before the December 2021 publication of the ITIE-RDC report, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi expressed a desire to renegotiate unbalanced contracts in favor of “win-win deals."" Prompted by public debate surrounding the Sicomines project and ITIE-RDC’s findings, he instructed his government -- including a government auditor called the Inspection Generale des Finances (IGF) – to investigate the 2008 “convention de collaboration” and its corresponding amendments. He also disbanded the BCPSC. The findings of ITIE-RDC evaluation were later corroborated by an IGF audit, which provided a basis for the Congolese Government to renegotiate the “convention de collaboration” with CREC, Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. A February 2023 IGF audit claimed that CREC, Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt had earned approximately $10 billion in profit, while the Congolese Government received loan disbursements worth less than $900 million for infrastructure projects. It also admonished Sicomines SARL for contracting the $1,771,048,731.89 pre-financing (PxF) facility in 2020, calling it an opaque form of borrowing and a violation of the DRC’s Foreign Exchange Regulations and Mine Regulations. Then, in May 2023, Tshisekedi traveled to China to discuss the future of the Sicomines agreement. In January 2024, Tshisekedi was sworn in after a winning second five-year presidential term following a landslide electoral victory in December 2023. When he took the oath of office on before a packed crowd at Kinshasa's iconic Stade des Martyrs, he announced that billions of dollars would soon be available thanks to a renegotiation of the controversial Sicomines deal. Without providing further details, he announced “the upcoming allocation of funds from the envelope obtained as part of the renegotiation of the Sicomines project [...] which should reach a total amount of $7 billion."" Then, on March 14, 2024, a fifth amendment to the “convention de collaboration” (Avenant No. 5 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was signed. Under the terms of the fifth amendment, Gécamines is entitled to receive royalty payments worth 1.2% of all copper and cobalt sales and market 32% of extracted minerals, while the Chinese owners of Sicomines SARL are entitled to sell the remaining 68% of extracted minerals. The fifth amendment also authorizes Sicomines SARL to borrow an additional $5,808,000,000 for infrastructure projects over a seventeen-year period (2024-2040) -- including a $624,000,000 borrowing in 2024 and $324,00,000 annual borrowings between 2025 and 2040 -- so long as the international price of copper is equal to or greater than $8,000 per ton. Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013 and the first phase of the mining project was completed on November 6, 2015. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020. Upon completion of the project’s second phase, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity). According to the Direction Générale de la Dette Publique (DGDP) within the Congolese Ministry of Finance and Sicomines SARL, the borrower made principal and interest payments to China Eximbank under the $2,610,000,000 loan agreement worth $261,428,542.23 during calendar year 2018, an unknown amount during calendar year 2019, $275 million during calendar year 2020, and $267 million during calendar year 2021. However, it also failed to make scheduled principal and/or interest payments worth $22,651,931.70 during calendar year 2021. The loan's principal amount outstanding was $1,878,696,921.85 as of December 31, 2017, $1,610,337,708.68 as of December 31, 2019, $1,354,761,750.61 as of December 31, 2020 and $1,110,413,682.31 as of December 31, 2021.","1.

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68% equity stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32%. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects.   The April 2008 agreement also specified the ownership structure of the Sicomines joint venture: CREC would hold a 43% equity stake in the joint venture, while Sinohydro would hold a 25% equity stake, Gécamines would hold a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) would hold a 12% equity stake.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, such that CREC was given a 28% equity stake, Sinohydro was given a 20% equity stake, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was given a 20% equity stake, Gécamines was given a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika was given a 12% equity stake. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, with CREC holding a 33% equity stake, Sinohydro holding a 30% equity stake, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt holding a 5% equity stake, Gécamines holding a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika holding a 12% equity stake.   Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” the consortium of Chinese companies reportedly agreed to provide $2.982 billion via (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) a $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; (3) a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi; and (4) and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. Ultimately, however, it provided financial commitments worth $3.28 billion through (1) a $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to Sicomines SARL; (2) a $2.13 billion (buyer's credit) loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) to Sicomines SARL; (3) a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines; and (4) a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Record ID#73204, Record ID#100887, and Record ID#100888 capture the respective contributions of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to the $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan. Record ID#73145 captures the $2.13 billion loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91873. The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91875. The Congolese government initially agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.     However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and reportedly removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank, while leaving the sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.     Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013 and the first phase of the mining project was completed on November 6, 2015. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020.  The mine's dressing system completed a successful trial operation on March 28, 2021.  Then, on July 15, 2021, another major Phase 2 milestone was achieved when a roasting oven was fired. Another significant milestone was achieved in March 2023 when the Busanga hydroelectric power plant, which delivers electricity to the Sicomines mining complex, was put into operation. Upon completion of Phase 2, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).     According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 98% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,130,000,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020. BCPSC also reported in 2020 that Sicomines SARL was scheduled to make the following debt service payments on the China Eximbank mining loan between 2021 and 2025: $106.8 million in 2021, $106.8 million in 2022, $106.8 million in 2023, $106.8 million in 2024, and $82.8 million in 2025. The total amount outstanding under the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan was $1,797,430,000 as of December 31, 2018, $1,797,430,000 as of December 31, 2019, $1,702,814,509 as of December 31, 2020, and $2,088,350,000 as of December 31, 2021.","1.

BCPSC data on disbursements and repayments under the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Sicomines Copper and Cobalt Mining Project can be found in Table 28 of this EITI report (https://www.dropbox.com/s/0d9b4o35y5p9k4z/RAPPORT%20D%27EVALUATION_PROJET%20SICOMINES_Version%20Finale.pdf?dl=0). 4. Principal repayments on the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan do not appear to have commenced until 2014, which implies a grace period of 6 years.5. The China Eximbank mining loan was not initially disclosed as a publicly-guaranteed debt by the Congolese Government. However, multiple Congolese Government publications later identified it as publicly-guaranteed debt. Therefore, AidData has coded it as a loan that benefits from a sovereign guarantee.

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68% equity stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32%. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement also specified the ownership structure of the Sicomines joint venture: CREC would hold a 43% equity stake in the joint venture, while Sinohydro would hold a 25% equity stake, Gécamines would hold a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) would hold a 12% equity stake.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, such that CREC was given a 28% equity stake, Sinohydro was given a 20% equity stake, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was given a 20% equity stake, Gécamines was given a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika was given a 12% equity stake. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, with CREC holding a 33% equity stake, Sinohydro holding a 30% equity stake, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt holding a 5% equity stake, Gécamines holding a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika holding a 12% equity stake.  Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” the consortium of Chinese companies reportedly agreed to provide $2.982 billion via (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) a $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; (3) a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi; and (4) and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. Ultimately, however, it provided financial commitments worth $3.28 billion through (1) a $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to Sicomines SARL; (2) a $2.13 billion (buyer's credit) loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) to Sicomines SARL; (3) a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines; and (4) a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Record ID#73204, Record ID#100887, and Record ID#100888 capture the respective contributions of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to the $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan.  Record ID#73145 captures the $2.13 billion loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91873.  The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91875. The Congolese government initially agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced the size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and reportedly removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank, while leaving the sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.    Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013 and the first phase of the mining project was completed on November 6, 2015. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020.  The mine's dressing system completed a successful trial operation on March 28, 2021.  Then, on July 15, 2021, another major Phase 2 milestone was achieved when a roasting oven was fired. Another significant milestone was achieved in March 2023 when the Busanga hydroelectric power plant, which delivers electricity to the Sicomines mining complex, was put into operation. Upon completion of Phase 2, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).      According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 98% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,130,000,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020. BCPSC also reported in 2020 that Sicomines SARL was scheduled to make the following debt service payments on the China Eximbank mining loan between 2021 and 2025: $106.8 million in 2021, $106.8 million in 2022, $106.8 million in 2023, $106.8 million in 2024, and $82.8 million in 2025.  The total amount outstanding under the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan was $1,702,814,509 as of December 31, 2020 and $2,088,350,000 as of December 31, 2021.   According to the Direction Générale de la Dette Publique (DGDP) within the Congolese Ministry of Finance, the borrower made principal payments under the $1,070,000,000 interest-free shareholder loan agreement worth $0 during calendar year 2020 and $148,977,360.00 during calendar year 2021. The loan's principal amount outstanding was $487,872,271.91 as of December 31, 2019, $739,350,671,91 as of December 31, 2020 and $590,373,311.91 as of December 31, 2021.","1.

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68% equity stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32%. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement also specified the ownership structure of the Sicomines joint venture: CREC would hold a 43% equity stake in the joint venture, while Sinohydro would hold a 25% equity stake, Gécamines would hold a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) would hold a 12% equity stake.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, such that CREC was given a 28% equity stake, Sinohydro was given a 20% equity stake, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was given a 20% equity stake, Gécamines was given a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika was given a 12% equity stake. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership structure of the joint venture, with CREC holding a 33% equity stake, Sinohydro holding a 30% equity stake, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt holding a 5% equity stake, Gécamines holding a 20% equity stake, and Mr. Gilbert Kalamba Banika holding a 12% equity stake.  Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” the consortium of Chinese companies reportedly agreed to provide $2.982 billion via (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) a $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; (3) a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi; and (4) and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. Ultimately, however, it provided financial commitments worth $3.28 billion through (1) a $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to Sicomines SARL; (2) a $2.13 billion (buyer's credit) loan from China Eximbank (with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity) to Sicomines SARL; (3) a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines; and (4) a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Record ID#73204, Record ID#100887, and Record ID#100888 capture the respective contributions of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt to the $1.07 billion interest-free shareholder loan.  Record ID#73145 captures the $2.13 billion loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91873.  The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Record ID#91875. The Congolese government initially agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced the size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and reportedly removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank, while leaving the sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.    Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013 and the first phase of the mining project was completed on November 6, 2015. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020.  The mine's dressing system completed a successful trial operation on March 28, 2021.  Then, on July 15, 2021, another major Phase 2 milestone was achieved when a roasting oven was fired. Another significant milestone was achieved in March 2023 when the Busanga hydroelectric power plant, which delivers electricity to the Sicomines mining complex, was put into operation. Upon completion of Phase 2, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).      According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 98% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,130,000,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020. BCPSC also reported in 2020 that Sicomines SARL was scheduled to make the following debt service payments on the China Eximbank mining loan between 2021 and 2025: $106.8 million in 2021, $106.8 million in 2022, $106.8 million in 2023, $106.8 million in 2024, and $82.8 million in 2025.  The total amount outstanding under the $2.13 billion China Eximbank mining loan was $1,702,814,509 as of December 31, 2020 and $2,088,350,000 as of December 31, 2021.   According to the Direction Générale de la Dette Publique (DGDP) within the Congolese Ministry of Finance, the borrower made principal payments under the $1,070,000,000 interest-free shareholder loan agreement worth $0 during calendar year 2020 and $148,977,360.00 during calendar year 2021. The loan's principal amount outstanding was $487,872,271.91 as of December 31, 2019, $739,350,671,91 as of December 31, 2020 and $590,373,311.91 as of December 31, 2021.","1.

Then, on March 19, 2003, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 336.15 million ($40.5 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the same project (as captured via Record ID#64488). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year grace period, a 15-year maturity, and a 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were used to be used the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China Nonferrous Metal Industry Corporation (CNMIC), which was signed on September 19, 2002.  The purpose of the $81.36 million project was to construct a Sin Quyen copper mine and processing complex in Lao Cai province. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the complex would be capable of producing 1.2 million tonnes of copper ore (to be smelted into 41,700 tonnes of pure copper), 113,000 tonnes of iron ore, 40,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, 19,600 tonnes of pyritic ore, and 341 kg of gold each year. Sin Quyen copper mine is now owned by Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries Group (Vinacomin) — a Vietnamese state-owned enterprise — and it was designed as a complex combining mining, dressing, smelting, acid-making, metal products recovery such as copper, gold, iron, sulfur and silver.  The Sin Quyen copper mine in Lao Cai Province, Vietnam, has caused significant environmental and social issues, including severe air pollution, dust, and odors that have disrupted local agriculture and forced repeated relocations of affected residents. Despite complaints and inspections confirming environmental damage, the mine's operators claim pollution levels are within acceptable limits. While mining remains a critical economic driver for the region, it continues to strain local livelihoods and provoke widespread dissatisfaction among the community.  CNMIC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced in April 2006 and was officially completed on August 25, 2008.","1.

The project site is located in Sukulu village in Eastern Uganda’s Tororo District. It is about 11 km outside Tororo town -- 5 km along the Busia-Tororo road -- near the Uganda-Kenya border.   23rd Metallurgical Construction Group Company Limited was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on October 16, 2015 and the phosphate fertilizer production plant was officially commissioned/completed on October 24, 2018. After the plant’s commissioning, it produced 50,000 tons of bio-organic fertilizer, which was distributed to tea, sugarcane and other commercial farms, for one planting season to test its effectiveness. The trial test was successful and commercial fertilizer production was expected to commence in January 2020. However, commercial fertilizer production was halted because of a legal dispute (due to alleged fraudulent acquisition and ownership of a multi-million dollar mineral deposit that led to the cancellation of Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited’s mining lease). Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited originally expected to commission a steel plant, sheet glass factory and slag cement plant in June 2019, but ICBC withheld loan disbursements because of legal challenges facing the company. ICBC also notified Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited in 2019 that it was withholding $60 million, at least part of which was the undisbursed balance of the $240 million loan, due to the introduction of a new policy that required ICBC to lower its overseas loan centralization ratio. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected project implementation, as many staff were either laid off or unable to return to the project site. The Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project was also plagued by corruption. In April 2019, two former senior officials at Uganda’s Ministry of Finance who had previously been arrested for soliciting a bribe a Chinese investors were sentenced to two years in prison. The Anti-Corruption Court at Kololo also banned the two officers who were interdicted in 2017, from holding any public office for 10 years. Presiding Judge Lawrence Gidudu convicted former principal finance officer, John Ogol Charles Ogol and Geoffrey Turyamuhika alias Tumwine (senior economist) for receiving and accepting a $50,000 bribe from Hassan Sserunjogi on March 27, 2017. According to evidence in court, the convicted persons received the money in exchange for expediting documentation for financing the construction of a power substation and transmission line at the Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project in Tororo. In addition to the jail punishment, Justice Gidudu ordered Ogol and Turyamuhika to pay a fine of Shs 4.8 million each. Then, in September 2022, President Museveni lamented the fact that Ugandan Ministry of Finance officials had cheated the project owner. He said ‘That Chinese man, they took bribes from him’ [and] ‘I have reached out to the President of China to get me another investor if the other one has problems. Or else I will get a solution. Tororo will give us phosphorus, associated gas, nitrogen and Lake Katie will give us potassium’.  The Osukuru Industrial Complex in Tororo district, Uganda, led by Guangzhou Dongsong Energy Group, has sparked concerns over significant environmental risks. The project encompasses a phosphate and rare earth mine, a fertilizer factory, a steel mill, and a power plant. Critics have highlighted the lack of comprehensive measures to address environmental challenges, including chemical exposure and emissions from mining and industrial activities. The potential for water and soil contamination, along with harmful emissions, poses risks to local ecosystems and public health, emphasizing the need for stricter environmental oversight. Governmental risks have also been a focal point of criticism, with allegations of corruption and mismanagement in Uganda's mining sector. Licenses for mining exploration have reportedly been granted in protected areas, threatening biodiversity and violating conservation principles. Moreover, questions have arisen about the adequacy of regulatory frameworks and enforcement, as some investors are accused of failing to meet environmental and operational standards. These governance issues undermine public trust and complicate efforts to ensure sustainable development. On a social level, the project has displaced local communities, leading to significant disruptions in livelihoods. Villagers have reported being coerced into relinquishing land rights without clear terms or fair compensation, and promises of land titles remain unfulfilled for many. This has resulted in loss of farmland, reduced food security, and economic hardship, with families struggling to sustain their livelihoods or afford basic needs like education. These challenges highlight the urgent need for more transparent, equitable, and community-focused approaches to resource development in Uganda.","1. This project is also known as the Osukuru Industrial Complex Project, the Sukulu Phosphate Project in Tororo, and Phase 1 of the Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project. The Chinese project title is 苏库卢碳酸岩综合产业开发项目 or 托罗罗地区的苏库鲁磷酸工厂项目2. Some sources indicate that, while ICBC issued a $240 million loan for Phase 1 of the project, it agreed to lend Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited up to $520 million for the project as a whole. 3. This project supported the development of phosphorite mine, iron mine, niobium mine, rare earth mine, fertilizer manufacturing facilities and refining facilities. 4. Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited is also known as Guangzhou DongSong Energy Group Company and M/S Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group Company. 5. It is known that ICBC and Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited amended and restructured their loan agreement (project financing facility) in 2020 and 2022. However, the specific changes that were made are unknown. This issue warrants further investigation.

34115,3275,3701,2007 syndicated loan for Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine Project,China (People's Republic of),Myanmar,MMR,Asia,2007,2009,2011,Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine,37,37,Nickel,CDB contributes to syndicated loan for Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine Project (Linked to Record ID#103195),"On July 28, 2008, China Nonferrous Metal Mining & Construction signed a production sharing contract with Myanmar’s Ministry of Mines No. 3 Mining Enterprise for the Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine. China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group created a joint venture in order to implement the Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine Project. The total cost of the project was more than $870 million and it reportedly secured debt financing from China Eximbank and China Development Bank. Previously in June 2007, the nickel mining project was approved by the government and reportedly secured the commitment of financial support from China Development Bank and China Eximbank. Construction was expected to begin later in 2007.   The purpose of the project was to develop a nickel mine within Tigyaing Township, Katha District, Sagaing Region (exact locational coordinates are 23.578243, 96.152611). The mine has a reserve of more than 30 million tons of high-grade nickel ore containing some 700,000 tons of nickel. The average nickel content of the mine is 2%, which is likely to yield 800,000 metric tons (annual output of 85,000 tons) of ferro-nickel. On May 17, 2009, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place. The mine was completed in June 2011. It reportedly employs more than 1,500 workers, both Myanmar and Chinese nationals.  The project faced various controversies and disputes. According to a Myanmar Times report in 2016, a contract that China’s CNMC Nickel Company Ltd. (CNICO) signed in 2007 called for the seizure of more than 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) of land and the payment of 50,000 kyats (U.S. $32) an acre in lost crop compensation for 122 farmers in five communities comprising the Maung Kone village tract. Maung Kone residents later reported that the compensation they received failed to take into account the contamination of their fields and the nearby Irrawaddy River by the plant’s solid waste runoff, and they demanded additional payment. The 500 acres of land on which the plant’s operators dumped coal waste were nearly full, villagers said, so that when it rains, the runoff flowed directly into the waterway and nearby cultivated fields.   Residents of Maung Kone village, which sits between the nickel-mining operations and a sugar-processing plant, also said that polluted air and solid waste from both operations affected their health, and they accused both plants of discharging wastewater directly into the Irrawaddy River. When residents went to the village tract health department to discuss the situation, the medical officer in charge reportedly said he could not answer their questions because he did not have permission from his superiors. According to the Myanmar Alliance of Transparency and Accountability, the July 28, 2008 production sharing contract has also proven controversial because it provides for the Government of Myanmar to receive only 1 percent of revenue, and the Chinese company 99 percent, when the price of nickel falls below $15,000 a ton. The ratio is adjusted to 50:50 when the price of nickel is between $15,000 and $20,000 a ton.  There are existing environmental, social, and governance challenges associated with the implementation of this mine. There have been efforts taken to mitigate negative social effects. The Tagaung Taung nickel mine in Myanmar, operated by China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company (CNMC), has come under scrutiny for failing to fulfill its monetary commitments to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, which are meant to mitigate social and environmental impacts on the local community.   The contract requires CNMC to spend $300,000 annually on CSR initiatives, but reports indicate that only K120 million (approximately $53,000) was spent in a recent year. Moreover, part of the CSR funds—about K10 million—was diverted to government departments for unrelated purposes, such as building toilets and purchasing equipment. Ko Tin Myo Tun, the head of the mine's basic labor union, criticized this lack of transparency, saying, “The company said it used about K200 million in its CSR activities, but we have discovered that the township General Administration Department took K6 million to build new toilets and buy a projector and the township Immigration Department took K4 million.”  The mismanagement of CSR funds has frustrated local stakeholders, who argue that the money should directly benefit the affected communities. Lawmaker U Thein Han also confirmed the misuse of funds and called for CNMC to fully utilize the agreed CSR budget as per its contractual obligations. These concerns are compounded by broader criticisms of the mine’s operations, including labor disputes and an unequal revenue-sharing agreement that limits its contributions to the region's development.","1.

China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group created a joint venture in order to implement the Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine Project. The total cost of the project was more than $870 million and it reportedly secured debt financing from China Eximbank and China Development Bank. Previously in June 2007, the nickel mining project was approved by the government and reportedly secured the commitment of financial support from China Development Bank and China Eximbank. Construction was expected to begin later in 2007.  The purpose of the project was to develop a nickel mine within Tigyaing Township, Katha District, Sagaing Region (exact locational coordinates are 23.578243, 96.152611). The mine has a reserve of more than 30 million tons of high-grade nickel ore containing some 700,000 tons of nickel. The average nickel content of the mine is 2%, which is likely to yield 800,000 metric tons (annual output of 85,000 tons) of ferro-nickel. On May 17, 2009, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place. The mine was completed in June 2011. It reportedly employs more than 1,500 workers, both Myanmar and Chinese nationals.  The project faced various controversies and disputes. According to a Myanmar Times report in 2016, a contract that China’s CNMC Nickel Company Ltd. (CNICO) signed in 2007 called for the seizure of more than 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) of land and the payment of 50,000 kyats (U.S. $32) an acre in lost crop compensation for 122 farmers in five communities comprising the Maung Kone village tract. Maung Kone residents later reported that the compensation they received failed to take into account the contamination of their fields and the nearby Irrawaddy River by the plant’s solid waste runoff, and they demanded additional payment. The 500 acres of land on which the plant’s operators dumped coal waste were nearly full, villagers said, so that when it rains, the runoff flowed directly into the waterway and nearby cultivated fields.  Residents of Maung Kone village, which sits between the nickel-mining operations and a sugar-processing plant, also said that polluted air and solid waste from both operations affected their health, and they accused both plants of discharging wastewater directly into the Irrawaddy River. When residents went to the village tract health department to discuss the situation, the medical officer in charge reportedly said he could not answer their questions because he did not have permission from his superiors. According to the Myanmar Alliance of Transparency and Accountability, the July 28, 2008 production sharing contract has also proven controversial because it provides for the Government of Myanmar to receive only 1 percent of revenue, and the Chinese company 99 percent, when the price of nickel falls below $15,000 a ton. The ratio is adjusted to 50:50 when the price of nickel is between $15,000 and $20,000 a ton.","1. The Chinese project title is 达贡山镍矿 or 缅甸达贡山镍矿项目.2..

36064,1674,3901,2010 $2 billion overseas investment loan for capital expenditures related to Toromocho Copper Mine Project,China (People's Republic of),Peru,PER,America,2010,2011,2015,Toromocho Copper Mine,39,39,Copper,China Eximbank provides $2 billion overseas investment loan for capital expenditures related to Toromocho Copper Mine Project (Linked to Record ID#56098),"Between June and August 2007, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) acquired 100% of the shares in the Toromocho Copper Mine Project for CAD 840 million ($789 million) . Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru).  Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Record ID#36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points and a 15-year maturity. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Record ID#56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco. The supplementary loan agreement was also collateralized against all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Mining Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. As of 2016, the entirety of this loan facility was drawn down.   The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%.   CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusual heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs. The Toromocho Copper Mine Project began commercial production on June 17, 2015.  The Toromocho Project has implemented environmental measures, including constructing the Kingsmill Tunnel Water Treatment Plant in 2011 to treat wastewater and improve water quality in the Yauli River. Following an acid runoff incident in 2014, Chinalco upgraded the drainage system to prevent future occurrences. Despite these efforts, concerns persist, such as high levels of silver in children’s blood reported in 2019, indicating potential gaps in environmental risk mitigation. Monitoring and further action are needed to address these ongoing challenges.  To mitigate social risks, Chinalco funded the resettlement of over 4,000 residents to Nueva Morococha, providing improved infrastructure and public services. However, locals have criticized poor housing conditions, high unemployment, and a lack of economic opportunities in the new settlement. The shift to capital-intensive open-pit mining displaced many unskilled local workers who previously relied on underground mining, leaving them with precarious, short-term jobs. While the Dialogue Table was introduced to address community grievances, it has been perceived as ineffective, further straining relations between Chinalco and the affected communities.  Governance measures included the approval of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2010 and its subsequent updates. However, the process lacked transparency and meaningful community participation, sparking criticism. A significant source of contention is Chinalco's claim to 34 hectares of land in Antigua Morococha, which locals argue was unjustly transferred. Efforts to challenge the claim in court have failed, exacerbating tensions and highlighting the need for more equitable and transparent governance practices to ensure that local communities benefit from the project.",1.

('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — entered into an $83 million loan (facility) agreement with China Development Bank. The loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.5% margin. The purpose of the loan was the construction, maintenance, and operation of the Kingsmill Tunnel water treatment plant at the Toromocho Project. The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%. CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusual heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs. The Toromocho Copper Mine Project began commercial production on June 17, 2015. The Kingsmill Tunnel water treatment plant treats wastewater before it is discharged into the Yauli River. The plant has significantly improved the region's underground water which had been contaminated by decades of irresponsible mining by a range of companies from Peru and North America (such as the Cerro de Pasco Corporation and Doe Run from the United States, and subsidiaries of Pan American Silver from Canada).",1.

Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru). Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Record ID#36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Record ID#56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco.

95749,228,4101,2012 $200 million loan for Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project,China (People's Republic of),Kazakhstan,KAZ,Asia,2012,NA,NA,Zhomart Copper Mine,41,41,Copper,CDB provides $200 million loan for Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project,"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit. All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled. The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

89508,791,9908A,2018 $1.3 billion loan for Tianqi Lithium Corporation to acquire 23.77% ownership stake in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.,China (People's Republic of),Chile,CHL,America,2018,NA,NA,Unallocable,9999,9998,Lithium,"China CITIC Bank provides $1.3 billion loan for Tianqi Lithium Corporation to acquire 23.77% ownership stake in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (Linked to Record ID#54940, ID#89512, and ID#89509)","In May 2018, Tianqi Lithium Corporation (TLC) entered into the Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) Share Purchase Agreement with Nutrien, pursuant to which TLC agreed to purchase and Nutrien agreed to sell 62,556,568 Series A shares in SQM at a consideration of approximately $4.07 billion (see Record ID#54940). In addition to its cash on hand, TLC financed the consideration for the SQM Transaction through three bank borrowings. On October 26, 2018, the Chengdu Branch of China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited signed a $2.5 billion term loan agreement (""Onshore Syndicated Facility Agreement"") with Tianqi Lithium Australia Investments 1 Pty. Ltd. (TLAI1) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of TLC — to support TLC’s acquisition of a 23.77% ownership stake in SQM and thereby help it gain access to a coveted source of supply of metallic lithium, one of the key raw materials for the production of rechargeable batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles. This $2.5 billion loan is split into a $1.3 billion senior tranche (see Record ID#89508) with a two-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2020) and a $1.2 billion senior tranche (see Record ID#89509) with a three-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2021). The interest rates for these two loans range from LIBOR plus a 2.70% margin to LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. This $2.5 billion term loan is collateralized against TLC’s 23.77% ownership stake in SQM and a pledge over TLC shares in (i) Shehong Tianqi, (ii) Tianqi Lithium (Jiangsu), (iii) Tianqi Australia Investments 1, (iv) ITS, (v) TLEA, (vi) Chongqing Tianqi, and (vii) Shigatse Zabuye. Moreover, both tranches are backed by a TLC repayment guarantee. A few days later on October 29, 2018, five banks — China CITIC Bank International, BNP Paribas, China Minsheng Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Societe Generale — signed a $1 billion mezzanine syndicated term loan facility agreement (""Offshore Syndicated Facility Agreement"") with Tianqi Lithium Australia Investments 2 Pty. Ltd. (TLAI2) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of TLC. China CITIC Bank's and ICBC's combined contribution to this loan is recorded in Record ID#89512. This syndicated loan has a two-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2020). The interest rates for this loan range from LIBOR plus a 2.70% margin to LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The $1 billion syndicated mezzanine syndicated term loan is collateralized against an account pledge of ITS, TLC’s 23.77% ownership stake in SQM, and a pledge over TLC shares in (i) Tianqi Xinlong, (ii) Tianqi Australia Investments 2, (iii) TLEA, (iv) Chongqing Tianqi, and (v) Shigatse Zabuye. This loan is also backed by a TLC repayment guarantee. After signing the agreements, TLAI1 fully drew down on the $1.3 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility A’) and the $1.2 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility B’). TLAI2 fully drew down on the $1 billion syndicated mezzanine syndicated term loan (known as 'facility C'). Since the end of 2019, the price of lithium products have been in decline, Tianqi Lithium's liquidity supply began running low, and their debt ratio continued to rise. Therefore, they began having issues meeting their repayment obligations on these three loan facilities. Pursuant to an Amendment and Extension Deed, the parties to the three facilities agreed to (i) extend the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 26, 2021, subject to automatic extension to November 25, 2022 upon fulfillment of certain conditions, and (ii) extend the maturity date of facility B to November 29, 2023. On July 2, 2021, the borrowers fulfilled all conditions required referred to in (i) and extended the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 25, 2022. The interest rates of the facilities after extension were reset to LIBOR plus 2.00% for each of the facilities, and plus 0.90%, 2.20% and 3.90%, respectively, for facility A, facility B and facility C. In December 2020, TLC disclosed in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that IGO, an Australian miner, had agreed to pay $1.4 billion for a 49% equity stake in Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, which would give IGO a 25% equity stake in the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia and a 49% holding of the Kwinana lithium processing plant, also in Western Australia. Through the sale, TLC would also be able to make a $1.2 billion principal payment on one of the loans that it raised in October 2018. At the time, TLC was struggling to repay the borrowing, amid challenges that arose after a drop in the price of lithium, as well as a Covid-linked slump in the electric car industry, where lithium-ion batteries are most commonly used. TLC said in a separate filing in December 2020 that it had gained lenders’ consent to extend the outstanding amount of around $1.884 billion on the one year tranches to November 26, 2021. If TLC managed to complete the Australian sale and make the $1.2 billion principal payment, the loan’s final maturity date could be extended further to November 25, 2022. Tianqi also noted in the filing that $416 million of the $1 billion offshore one year tranche was repaid with the proceeds raised from a rights issue in January 2020. TLC also extended the final maturity date of the $1.2 billion three year tranche to November 29, 2023, which carries a further one year extension option. After TLC disclosed in a stock exchange filing on December 1, 2020 that it reached an agreement with the lender syndicate to extend the maturity on the one year tranches to December 28, 2020, Moody’s downgraded it to Caa2 from Caa1, and said that the extension constituted a missed payment default under the rating agency’s definition as the company did not meet its original debt obligation.","1.

Through the sale, TLC would also be able to make a $1.2 billion principal payment on one of the loans that it raised in October 2018. At the time, TLC was struggling to repay the borrowing, amid challenges that arose after a drop in the price of lithium, as well as a Covid-linked slump in the electric car industry, where lithium-ion batteries are most commonly used. TLC said in a separate filing in December 2020 that it had gained lenders’ consent to extend the outstanding amount of around $1.884 billion on the one year tranches to November 26, 2021. If TLC managed to complete the Australian sale and make the $1.2 billion principal payment, the loan’s final maturity date could be extended further to November 25, 2022. Tianqi also noted in the filing that $416 million of the $1 billion offshore one year tranche was repaid with the proceeds raised from a rights issue in January 2020. TLC also extended the final maturity date of the $1.2 billion three year tranche to November 29, 2023, which carries a further one year extension option. After TLC disclosed in a stock exchange filing on December 1, 2020 that it reached an agreement with the lender syndicate to extend the maturity on the one year tranches to December 28, 2020, Moody’s downgraded it to Caa2 from Caa1, and said that the extension constituted a missed payment default under the rating agency’s definition as the company did not meet its original debt obligation.","1.

It carried a maturity period of five years, and an amortizing structure. The facility was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the assignment of copper export proceeds up to the final buyers and by first demand guarantees from RCC. The PXF covers RCC's export of copper cathode and copper wire rod. The proceeds were to be used by the borrower to refinance its existing debt and for working capital purposes.  In addition to ICBC, the following lenders contributed to the loan syndicate: Natixis, Société Générale S.A. (SocGen), Rosbank, Alfa Bank, Nordea, Sberbank Europe, Trafigura Beheer (through its Galena arm), Amsterdam Trade Bank, Fimbank, and Federated. Natixis, SocGen, and Rosbank acted as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners; the other eight lenders joined in syndication, which was launched in October 2013 and closed in November 2013. Nordea, Sberbank Europe, and Alfa Bank acted as mandated lead arrangers. ICBC, Amsterdam Trade Bank, and Trafigura served as lead arrangers. Fimbank and Federated Project and Trade Finance served as arrangers. Natixis served as facility and security agent. Natixis Bank and Rosbank served as passport banks.  The deal was refinanced and increased to a five-year $300 million USD loan in November 2016, although ICBC is not known to have not participated in that loan.","1. Russian Copper Company (RCC) — also known as Russkaya Mednaya Kompaniya — is Russia's third-largest copper producer. It is legally incorporated and headquartered in Russia. Igor Altushkin is RCC's founder and largest shareholder.2. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.3. The individual contribution of the 11 lenders to this $250 million USD syndicated loan is unknown.

On 22 February 2006, negotiations concluded, and in March 2006 the companies formalized a joint venture agreement by which they established Copper Partners Investment Company Ltd. (CuPIC). Under this agreement, Codelco would receive an advance of 550 million USD as a payment from the joint venture for a long-term purchase contract by which Codelco would sell annually 55,750 tons of copper to CuPIC for a period of 15 years. In turn, CuPIC would sell the copper to Minmetals under market terms through a long-term sales contract which similarly covers a period of 15 years. These monthly shipments were in operation by June 2006. Minmetals, meanwhile, would have an option before and after the year of 2009 to acquire at market price 25 to 49 percent of the shares in Gaby copper mine newly developed by Codelco. On 23 September 2008, both companies signed an agreement that suspended indefinitely Minmetal's option to obtain a stake in Gaby copper mine.  In connection with this transaction, the two sides appointed China Development Bank as the lead organizer and underwriter for a term loan facility to the joint venture company. As the arranging bank, loan provider, agent bank and guarantee agent bank for the copper project of Minmetals and Codelco, China Development Bank designed the financing structure and would provide 330 million US dollars for a term of 11 years with a fixed interest rate of 6.5%. The CDB loan is captured in Record ID #37231.  The remaining 220 million USD that CuPIC would provide to Codelco as advance payment for the long-term sales contract would be financed through equity investments made equally by Minmetals and Codelco. According to the Sponsor Agreement dated 8 March 2006, the subsidiary Codelco International Ltd. agreed to transfer its rights held in Copper Partners Investment Company Ltd. as collateral security in favor of China Development Bank. As of December 2008, Codelco International Ltd. had ceded CH$267,143 in 2007 and CH$235,714 in 2008 of its rights to CuPIC to the China Development Bank as security collateral. In December of 2009, Codelco International Ltd. ceded another $240,565 worth of its CuPIC rights to the CDB. By March 2012, CuPIC had paid off its debt to the China Development Bank and, as of December of 2015, the contract was still operational.",NA,Completion,Commercial,Loan,0.25,OOF-like,320,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",NA,China Development Bank (CDB),State-owned Policy Bank,No,NA,NA,Copper Partners Investment Company Ltd.

(51% equity stake) and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., Ltd. (49% equity stake) that was legally incorporated in Indonesia — signed an RMB 6.88 billion ($1.06 billion) facility agreement with a group of Chinese state-owned banks for the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project. Participants in the loan syndicate included China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of China, and Tai Fung Bank. Bank of China served as the mandated lead arranger, financial adviser, onshore and offshore facility agent, and security agent. The facility had a 6.75-year (81-month) maturity. It was provided in three tranches: an RMB-denominated, Sinosure-backed tranche worth $886 million for the ‘offshore’ lenders that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; and a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The total cost of the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project is RMB 13.4 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 51:49. The purpose of the project is to construct a nickel mine, a 2.5 million metric tons per year stainless steel smelter, a 1,440MW (8X135MW) coal-fired power plant, and a 40 million metric tons multi-functional port in Virtue Dragon Industrial Park in South Sulawesi (exact locational coordinates: -3.827910421, 122.4682708). Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering and Suzhou Thvow Technology. Co., Ltd. are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. In September 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission approved the project. A contract to build the power plant was also awarded to Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering in September 2017. The contract specified an implementation period from October 2017 to July 31, 2019. Construction of the smelter began on or around October 2019. In April 2020, the smelter's first production line began to operate. Unit 1 was commissioned in April 2021. Unit 8 began operating in June 2021. Unit 9 began operating in January 2022. However, this project has also become a source of local protest and controversy. Residents living near the Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about pollution from coal dust almost immediately after the power station began operations. The coal dust reportedly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and coats everything, both indoors and outdoors. Children in the area have also reportedly begun coughing and having difficulty breathing.

Pinsent Masons acted as lenders’ legal counsel. Pinsent Masons advised the Bank of China and the financing syndicate. Hermawan Juniarto & Partners and Chang An Law Firm advised the Bank of China on Indonesian and PRC law, respectively. 2. Bank of China served as the security agent for the loan. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower's default under the loan. As such, AidData assumes that the syndicated loan was collateralized. 3. AidData has estimated the interest rate (4.8%) that applies to the loan by using the 5-year loan prime rate (LPR) -- a benchmark lending rate adopted by commercial banks in China -- in December 2019 (as reported by Bloomberg and Refinitiv).4. Tai Fung Bank Limited is 50.3% owned by Bank of China. 5. This project is also known as the Delong Nickel Phase II Power Station Project.

This project won the award for Project Finance Deal of the Year at the Asian Legal Business China Law Awards 2021. 7. Clearing conditions precedent on this complex transaction took more than a year. The project ultimately achieved financial close on February 3, 2021, more than a year after the debt financing package was finalized. 8.

(51% equity stake) and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., Ltd. (49% equity stake) that was legally incorporated in Indonesia — signed an RMB 6.88 billion ($1.06 billion) facility agreement with a group of Chinese state-owned banks for the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project. Participants in the loan syndicate included China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of China, and Tai Fung Bank. Bank of China served as the mandated lead arranger, financial adviser, onshore and offshore facility agent, and security agent. The facility had a 6.75-year (81-month) maturity. It was provided in three tranches: an RMB-denominated, Sinosure-backed tranche worth $886 million for the ‘offshore’ lenders that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; and a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The total cost of the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project is RMB 13.4 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 51:49. The purpose of the project is to construct a nickel mine, a 2.5 million metric tons per year stainless steel smelter, a 1,440MW (8X135MW) coal-fired power plant, and a 40 million metric tons multi-functional port in Virtue Dragon Industrial Park in South Sulawesi (exact locational coordinates: -3.827910421, 122.4682708). Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering and Suzhou Thvow Technology. Co., Ltd. are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. In September 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission approved the project. A contract to build the power plant was also awarded to Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering in September 2017. The contract specified an implementation period from October 2017 to July 31, 2019. Construction of the smelter began on or around October 2019. In April 2020, the smelter's first production line began to operate. Unit 1 was commissioned in April 2021. Unit 8 began operating in June 2021. Unit 9 began operating in January 2022. However, this project has also become a source of local protest and controversy. Residents living near the Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about pollution from coal dust almost immediately after the power station began operations. The coal dust reportedly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and coats everything, both indoors and outdoors. Children in the area have also reportedly begun coughing and having difficulty breathing.

Pinsent Masons acted as lenders’ legal counsel. Pinsent Masons advised the Bank of China and the financing syndicate. Hermawan Juniarto & Partners and Chang An Law Firm advised the Bank of China on Indonesian and PRC law, respectively. 2. Bank of China served as the security agent for the loan. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower's default under the loan. As such, AidData assumes that the syndicated loan was collateralized. 3. AidData has estimated the interest rate (4.8%) that applies to the loan by using the 5-year loan prime rate (LPR) -- a benchmark lending rate adopted by commercial banks in China -- in December 2019 (as reported by Bloomberg and Refinitiv).4. Tai Fung Bank Limited is 50.3% owned by Bank of China. 5. This project is also known as the Delong Nickel Phase II Power Station Project. The Chinese project title is 中国银行及11家中外银行组成的银团对位于印尼东南苏拉威西（South Sulawesi）10亿美元厦门象屿不锈钢一体化冶炼项目的融资. 6. This project won the award for Project Finance Deal of the Year at the Asian Legal Business China Law Awards 2021. 7. Clearing conditions precedent on this complex transaction took more than a year. The project ultimately achieved financial close on February 3, 2021, more than a year after the debt financing package was finalized. 8. The monetary values and pricing of the three tranches are unknown. The specific participants in each tranche are also unknown. As such, AidData has created a single record (see linked projects as well) to capture the entire RMB 6.88 billion syndicated loan for the time being. 9. The individual contributions of Bank of China, China Development Bank, ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, China CITIC Bank Corporation, China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd., and Tai Fung Bank Limited to the RMB 6.88 billion syndicated loan are unknown.
