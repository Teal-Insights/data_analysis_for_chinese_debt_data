# Applied Data Analysis for Chinese Overseas Lending Data Using R & LLMs

This is the textbook accompanying a four week long course taught by Teal Emery to the research analysts at AidData in February/March 2025. The materials are primarily developed for the class, but given that the textbook contains only publicly available information, AidData has graciously allowed the materials to be made available online to the general public.

If you spot typos or other mistakes, please submit it using GitHub Issues.
