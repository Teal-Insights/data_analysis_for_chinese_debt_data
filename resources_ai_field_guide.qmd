# A Field Guide to Using AI Effectively

## Overview

This chapter explores how to effectively use AI tools to enhance your R programming and data analysis workflow. We'll focus on practical applications specifically relevant to analyzing Chinese development finance data.

## Key Principles for Working with AI Tools

### 1. Be Specific and Contextualized

When working with AI tools, context is crucial. Include relevant details about your data, desired outcome, and any constraints. Compare these two prompts:

**Less Effective:**

```         
How do I make a histogram in R?
```

**More Effective:**

```         
I'm working with AidData's Chinese development finance dataset. I need to create
a histogram showing the distribution of loan amounts (in millions USD) for
infrastructure projects between 2000-2021. The visualization needs to follow
AidData's style guide with blue (#0047AB) as the primary color.
```

### 2. Iterate and Refine

Think of working with AI as a conversation rather than a one-shot interaction. Start broad and then refine based on the responses:

1.  Begin with your initial question
2.  Review the AI's response
3.  Ask for clarification or modifications
4.  Request explanations for unfamiliar concepts
5.  Validate the output against your domain knowledge

### 3. Verify and Validate

Always treat AI outputs as suggestions rather than definitive solutions:

-   Run the code in your environment to verify it works
-   Check that the results align with your domain knowledge
-   Verify any statistical claims or interpretations
-   Cross-reference with official documentation
-   Test with a small subset of your data first

## Practical Applications

### Code Generation

When asking AI to generate code, provide:

1.  The specific packages you're using
2.  Sample data structure
3.  Desired output format
4.  Any relevant constraints

Example prompt:

```         
I'm using the tidyverse packages to analyze Chinese development finance data.
My dataframe 'loans_df' has columns:
- project_id (character)
- amount_usd (numeric)
- sector (character)
- year (numeric)
- country (character)

I need code to:
1. Calculate the total lending by sector and year
2. Create a line plot showing trends over time by sector
3. Use AidData's color palette: #0047AB (blue), #FFB347 (orange), #50C878 (green)
```

### Code Explanation

When asking AI to explain code, specify:

1.  Your current knowledge level
2.  Which parts you find confusing
3.  What type of explanation would be most helpful

Example prompt:

```         
Can you explain this dplyr code line by line? I'm new to R and especially need
help understanding what group_by() and summarize() are doing:

loans_df |>
  group_by(sector, year) |>
  summarize(total_amount = sum(amount_usd, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()
```

### Debugging

When seeking debugging help:

1.  Share the complete error message
2.  Provide the relevant code context
3.  Describe what you've already tried
4.  Include sample data if possible

Example prompt:

```         
I'm getting this error when trying to join two dataframes:
"Error: joins must be length 1, not 2"

Here's my code:
loans_df |>
  left_join(projects_df, by = c("project_id", "year"))

Both dataframes have project_id and year columns. What might be causing this?
```

## Best Practices for Different AI Tools

### ChatGPT

-   Best for: Code explanation, general programming concepts, debugging
-   Use with: Clear code formatting, specific questions
-   Limitations: May not know recent R packages or updates

### Claude

-   Best for: Complex analysis workflows, nuanced explanations
-   Use with: Detailed context, multi-step problems
-   Strengths: Understanding context, generating complete solutions

### DeepSeek

-   Best for: Code generation, debugging, learning R basics

-   Use with: General programming questions, non-sensitive data

-   Limitations: Content restrictions on China-related topics

-   Privacy: Sketchy privacy policy. Consider using other providers for anything involving sensitive data.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1.  **Overreliance on AI**
    -   Always understand the code you're using
    -   Learn fundamental concepts rather than just copying solutions
    -   Use AI as a teaching tool, not just a solution generator
2.  **Incomplete Context**
    -   Provide sample data structure
    -   Specify package versions
    -   Include relevant constraints or requirements
3.  **Missing Validation**
    -   Test generated code with small data samples
    -   Verify statistical interpretations
    -   Check for edge cases and error handling

## Exercises

1.  Practice writing effective prompts for these common tasks:

    -   Data cleaning
    -   Visualization
    -   Statistical analysis
    -   Documentation

2.  Compare AI responses across different tools for the same query

3.  Debug common errors using AI assistance

## Next Steps
